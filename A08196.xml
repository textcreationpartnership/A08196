            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:13584:5"/>and readeth the trueth. D. Alen. D. Briſtow, D.

<pb facs="tcp:13584:6"/>ſome of them oftentimes tolde me at Rome, whoſe names I omitte to put in writing, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their conuerſion, (that the Romiſh faith was not the true faith.) Foure of theſe with mee determined very often, ſecretly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Rome, and returne to our countrey. But theſe foure Schollers, by their familiar frindes and fellowe Schollers, were with much a doe perſwaded to remaine at Rome, vntill by their Rectours they ſhoulde be ſent to England. But as for me, what I once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to do, by the ſuffera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god, that I thought to bring to paſſe, perſwaſions coulde nothyng cauſe me to change my purpoſe, I was perſwaded by diuers, both by the Ieſuites and by the ſchollers to remaine at Rome, but I woulde not, nor coulde not vnleſſe I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of my ſaluation, as I did during the time of my ſickneſſe, for that in hypocriſie I liued as a Papiſt, my conſcience ſtriued ſo mightily within me, that I feared not in talke with my fellowes to ſpeake againſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe religion, inſomuch that oftentimes I was at Rome called heritique. I appeale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them for teſtimonie of this trueth that haue heard mee ſo ſpeaking at Rome, but what is this to the purpoſe, greater was my
<pb facs="tcp:13584:6"/>ſinne, that for any temporall liuing, I ſhoulde forſake my God, wherefore very often trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled I am in conſcience, and grieued in mind that I committed ſuch an horrible offence in the ſight of God. In deede I muſt needes confeſſe that I beleeued vnfaignedly a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticall life to haue beene allowable before God, I graunted inuocation of Saintes, and as for tranſubſtantiation I doubted, theſe two pointes of the Romiſh religion, I did hold a little before my conuerſion at the Towre, to haue bene firme and agreeable to God his holy worde, and as for the thirde point which was tranſubſtantiation, I could not tell what to thinke therof, but nowe God be thanked I am reſolued in theſe three points as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to bee, this treatiſe is called the book of Pilgrimage, for that in my perigrina<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue ſeen with mine eies the moſt things which I haue written in this booke for your inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chriſtian readers, not for any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of mine, eſtimation, fame, or glorie to bee gotten thereby, as the Papiſtes doe ſurmize, I am briefer then I woulde bee, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are certaine bookes ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mee, and againſt my workes, whiche bookes if I may geat, I meane God willing to

I craue the ſpirite of mildneſſe, and not the ſpirite of ſcoffing, and taunting, which ſpirite they neuer want. Farewell louing readers, God graunt you a perfect faith and to me likewiſe, and alſo for my former ſinnes and hypocriſie, the fatherly viſitation of God here in this worlde, that I may once feele Gods loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes me a ſinner, an abiect and wormes meate, God be mercifull vnto me, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme my faith.

               <p>My mind and purpoſe is, if it may pleaſe God, and you my deare father, to make a voyage into Italie, there to beholde the ſtately Cities, to ſée the fertile fieldes, pleſaunt hylles, bate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paſtures, ſhadowing woodes, the plentie of al kind of trees and groues, the abundance of corne, vines and oliues, fayre cattell, ſweet ſpringes, fountaines, lakes, riuers, and hauens. For the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of Italie, is as it were an open lap, to receiue the trade of all countreys.

               <p>Hée counted the Pope as Antichriſt, his religion prophane, and of his Church he eſtéemed as of the Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Sathan.

<pb facs="tcp:13584:19"/>wearie, yea neuertheleſſe thou ſhalt finde (my ſonne) that the Pope is verye Antichriſte, as by his life and religion moſt manifeſtly ſhall appeare. I will tell thee (my ſonne) of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes of this Pope gregorie the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téenth, otherwiſe named (and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) hugo, (that is to ſay) hugh: and by his ſurname <hi>boncompagnion,</hi> good fellowe. His father at the beginning was ſuche a one as ſolde olde wares (which the Italians termed vechio) as olde yron, olde ſhowes, olde apparell, and ſuche like thinges. This man at laſte became ſomewhat riche, and vſed the trade of marchandize. Nowe this Pope Hugh was borne at <hi>Bolognia,</hi> and brought vp in learning there, where hée ſtudied the Ciuil and Canon lawes, and became publique profeſſour of both thoſe lawes in that Citie, where hee was borne. At Rome, and elſe where, before hée was made Cardinall, hée bare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie offices, as it was reported vnto mée. Some in <hi>Bolognia,</hi> tolde certayne of my acquaintance, that this Pope
<pb facs="tcp:13584:19"/>was maried, and by that wife begate thoſe children who are as yet aliue. Some ſay otherwiſe, that hée was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer married, but ſay that thoſe whome hée calleth his ſonnes, are in deede his Baſtardes: but whatſoeuer they bée, they are Gentlemen, whether they bée ſo in condition or no, I can not tell, but I am ſure they are noble men in wealth, and in worldelye pompe. The Popes ſyr name is <hi>boncompagnion,</hi> good fellowe, for that one of his Graundſyers accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him ſelfe with another Italian, to kill a Serpent, who did much hurte in the Countrey of Italie, in ſlaying both man and beaſt: and for this cauſe the Serpent being ſtayne, by one of this Popes Graundſyres, and by another Italian, from that day forwardes hée was called <hi>boncompagnion,</hi> and ſo was his father ſurnamed, and this Pope likewiſe. This Pope hath a brother in <hi>Bolognia,</hi> who hath the charge of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye affayres, and alſo the Popes ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarde, though ſome call him his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewe, hee hath the rule of all thinges at <hi>Bolognia.</hi>

For hee hopeth that by their witte and pollicie, by their induſtrie and labour, hee ſhall recouer to hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thoſe countreys againe and haue them in ſubiection. What the lyfe of this Pope is, thou maiſt reade (my ſonne) in diuerſe bookes, as thou trauayleſt to other countreys, but this I will ſay as I was infourmed by credible perſons that had beene traueylers to Rome, that <hi>Omnia in curia Romana ſunt vaena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</hi> All thinges are to bee ſolde for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the Court of Rome. If any man hath committed murther, if any man hath liued in adulterie, if any man
<pb facs="tcp:13584:20"/>hath offended in gluttonie, or drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, or what ſo euer cryme hée hath committed, come to this Pope with your purſe full of money, and for your ſyluer you ſhall bée abſolued and forgiuen of all your ſinnes. But if you come with an emptie purſe, you ſhall departe as you come, without anye indulgence and pardon of your ſinnes: no penye no pater noſter. If any will releaſe his brother from purgatorie, let him prouide money, and an owle will flye with his brother to heauen, wil you haue <hi>Agnos dei, graua benedicta, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalla,</hi> croſſes, beades, &amp;c. Then goe to this Pope and bring him a ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell of money, and you ſhall haue all theſe thinges. Oh my ſonne I tell thée the trueth before theſe my neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. For a brother of mine hath dwelt with the Popes chiefe Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layne, and hath ſeene the practiſes of this Pope Gregorye the thirteenth, and knoweth the faſhions of his Courte. Let not his hypocriſte delude thée, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:13584:21"/>lef his magnificent giftes deceiue thee: thou ſhalt peceiue by his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maieſticall ſtatelineſſe, that hee is the ſonne of perdicion: hée can not take the paynes (béeing luſtie of age) to goe on foote from his chamber to his chappell vppon feaſtiuall dayes, but muſt bée carried on eyght ſcarlette mens ſhouldiers.</p>
               <p>Oh pride, Lucifer like. When hée goeth in proceſſion, in the Citie hée is honoured as Chriſte, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his heade muſt carpettes bee layde, the walles muſt bee couered with the ſame, and the ſtreetes ſtrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with flowers and ruſhes.</p>
               <p>The ſwiſhers are placed as it were in battaile arraye, the meaner forte with their torches goe before, the richer Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens followe after, the Nouices of moffe monaſteries followe them, then come the fatte belled Monkes, Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, Abbotes, pryours, and ſuche lyke, after them the Byſhoppes, them
<pb facs="tcp:13584:21"/>the Popes Chamberlaynes, with his Miters, and after them followe the Cardinalles, then appeareth the Pope, not goyng on foote, but caryed on mens ſhoulders verye pontyfically, the trumpettes ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the double Cannons are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Which pontificallitye Chriſte hym ſelfe neuer vſed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this exceſſiue pride ſeuereth the the Pope from the Immitation of Chriſtes ſteppes.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt ſee my ſoone, that the Pope is not vertuous in deede though hée bée ſo accoumpted, but full of hypocryſie.</p>
               <p>Hée is (as the brute goeth at Rome) the cauſe of diſſentions in diuers Countreys, and hée onely was the cauſe of the late rebellion in Ireland. For commaundement was giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them of the ſeminary by the Pope, that they ſhoulde praye daylye for the proſperous ſucceſſe of <hi>Doctour Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13584:22"/>his affayres in Irelande. This Pope ſuccoureth rebelles and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, that in the tyme of the laſte commotion fledde out of the North.</p>

               <p>Sonne, thou aſkeſt mée a doubtfull queſtion.

               <p>I aſke, whether all popes that arrogantly claimed to them ſelues Supremacie in earth, and the falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſed ſucceſſion of Peter in the Sée A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike, were prophane in conuerſation of life.</p>

               <p>There were no ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant Popes, but they liued only Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianlike, and as their religion was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Gods worde, ſo their life and maners were contrarie to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the liuing God.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Triſander.</speaker>
               <p>But father, can you tell

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Panteleon.</speaker>
               <p>What their names were I knowe, and what their maners were likewiſe I knowe of certentie: but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as I haue ſaid ſomwhat of Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the xiii. I thinke it not amiſſs to tell what his predeceſſour was, and howe hée came to the Popedome, this Pope <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> deſcended of very poore Parentage, as at Rome is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him. At <hi>Minerua,</hi> hée was a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minican</hi> Friar for a certaine ſpace, then hée became <hi>Pryor</hi> of that Monaſterie, at what time Cardinall <hi>Morone</hi> was ſuſpected for one that ſauoured not of Popiſhe religion. Wherefore this <hi>Pryor Dominican</hi> was ſent by the Pope to heare Cardinall <hi>Morons</hi> confeſſion, which when hée vndertooke, and thought to haue hearde the Cardinals confeſſion, hée was reiected, for that hée was ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhop nor Cardinall: But a poore Fryar.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Dominican</hi> returned backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the Popes Courte, and tolde
<pb facs="tcp:13584:23"/>the Pope that Cardinall <hi>Morone</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to take him for his confeſſor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Cardinal, but a poore <hi>Dominican.</hi> The Pope hearing theſe wordes, was muche out of pactence, he was ſore offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and his wrath was ſo kindeled, that in his angrie moode, hée called for a Cardinals hatte, and gaue it vnto this <hi>Dominican,</hi> willing him foorthwith to go againe to Cardinall <hi>Morone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when hée came Cardinall like, Cardinall <hi>Morone</hi> ſubmitted himſelfe, yeelded to make his confeſſion before him, to anſwere to any Article that hée had to lay againſte him, and in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination hée ſhewed him ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Popes Lawes. It happened afterwardes, that this Pope dyed, and then, (as the order is) the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Cardinals aſſembled together, in a certaine appointed place of the Popes Courte, to elect and chooſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt themſelues, ſome méete man to take vpon him the charge of ſo great and Sathanicall function. The whole Colledge of Cardinalles, that were
<pb facs="tcp:13584:24"/>preſent there, except this one <hi>Dominican</hi> Cardinall, gaue their aſſent and conſent to this Cardinall <hi>Morone,</hi> that hee ſhoulde haue béene Pope: but when this <hi>Dominican</hi> Cardinal was aſked why hée gaue not his voyce with the reſt, he made this anſwere, I will neuer (ſaith hée) giue my voyce to any perſon ſuſpected of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Then ſpake Cardinall <hi>Morone</hi> I will not be Pope, though I might.</p>
               <p>Heereupon all the Cardinals were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that this Cardinall <hi>Morone</hi> ſhould elect whom he beſt fanſied, to bée Pope of Rome, which thing beeing graunted vnto him, hée vttered theſe wordes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I knowe none more worthie to bée made Pope, then the Cardinall of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> who refuſed to giue his voyce to my election, for that ſome time I was ſuſpected to bée an Heretike: a worthier man then hée to beare rule, may ſeldome or neuer bée found though wée ſought for one through out the worlde. Therefore ſéeing your graces good wil and pleaſure, was, that I ſhoulde chooſe whom I beſt liked to the Popedome, I nominate and
<pb facs="tcp:13584:24"/>pronounce this Cardinall of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</hi> Theſe wordes thus vttered, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cardinall in his degrée doing obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, came and kiſſed this newe Popes féete. This Pope had a nephewe, (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſome Romans to haue béene his baſtarde) whome hée created Cardinall ouer that Citie <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whereof he himſelfe had béene Cardinal before. This his nephewe (or rather as the common bruite or ſame goeth at Rome) was bounde apprentiſe to a poore Tailour, who dwelleth in the Engliſhe Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie at Rome: and becauſe hée was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnapt for that ſcience, this poore taylour came vnto his vncle, the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Pope <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> (but then a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> Frier in the monaſterie of <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ua</hi>) and tolde him that his nephewe was vnfitte to bée a taylour, for that hée ſawe no towardneſſe at all in him touching that Art. But ſée now (my ſonne) howe fortune fauoureth fooles, howe ſhée ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth the vnworthie. For this felow, the Popes nephewe can ſcarce reade his Maſſe booke, much leſſe vnderſtande it,
<pb facs="tcp:13584:25"/>and yet loe, on a ſodaine hée is created Cardinall of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> This Pope his vncle, as the report goeth, was a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter practicioner in hearing Nunnes confeſſions, and fitter to play the Cooke, then to ſupplie an office and roome of ſuche high dignitie, to the which the Maieſtie of Emperours &amp; kings, by the iudgement of the Papiſtes, is counted inferiour. This <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> at the firſt was a beggar, then afterwardes hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>Dominican</hi> Friar, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, a Cardinal, and in fine a Pope. Thus fortune exalted him to high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées of promotion. The recordation and remembrance of his priſtinate and former ſtate, before fortune had ſmiled on him, ſhoulde by right haue moued him to bee humble and lowly to all men in his Papall Maieſtie.</p>

               <p>Truely Father, as for his baſe eſtate of byrth, if his vertues were good, or if his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of wit was ſuche, that it ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the wiſedome of others. I dde not
<pb facs="tcp:13584:25"/>weigh nor make any account, nor doe ſo vilely thinke of his ſimple Parents that therefore I ſhoulde eſteeme him vnworthie to haue béene (as hee was) promoted to a higher degree of functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

            </sp>
            <pb facs="tcp:13584:26"/>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Panteleon.</speaker>
               <p>Yes that I can, and hew hée liued I will declare to thée as follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth. Hée was a blooddy perſecutor of the Chriſtians, and cauſed many a faithfull beléeuer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpell, moſt lamentably to bée burned: yea hée was the cauſe of that butcherly effuſion of Chriſtian blood at <hi>Paris,</hi> and in all other places of Fraunce. His ſucceſſour <hi>Gregorie</hi> xiiii. wickedly allowed, the cruell hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp; formentes ſhewed vpon the great Admirall of Fraunce, the inſtrument of God, for defence of true religion, and for the conſolation of the afflicted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Whiche facte is entred in marble ſtone, in the imperiall hall of the Popes Court, artificially ſet foorth: but to ſpeake of <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> this Pope was certified by a certaine Cardinall, that in Rome there was an noble man, ſonne to a Duke, borne in <hi>Germanie,</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fering from the Papiſtes in religion and diſagréeing with their doctrine. So ſoone as the Pope had heard theſe wordes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued with furious indignation, hée cried vnto the Cardinall, burne him,
<pb facs="tcp:13584:26"/>burne him: but the Cardinall béeing more mercifull then the Pope, deſired his graceleſſe Antichriſtian Maieſty, to commaunde the young noble youth to appeare before him, and ſo hée did. When the young Noble man came before his preſence, hée did proſtrate him ſelfe at the Popes féete, at whom the Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſo to raile, and ſo to threaten him, that the Noble man ouercome with his threatenings of death, was readie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue whatſoeuer hée woulde haue him beléeue, and ſo with his grimme counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and threatning words hée peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Noble young man to the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of perpetuall deſtruction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Triſander.</speaker>
               <p>Surely, this man was more bitter then prudent, and more grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of vndeſerued ſubiection, then care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ouer the life of true Chriſtians. Fie vpon ſuch a proude perſecutor, from ſuch Tirants, <hi>libera nos Domine.</hi> But fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it was tolde mée, that hée was a great Coniurer or Nigromancer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Panteleon.</speaker>
               <p>And in very déede (as I ſuppoſe) thou haſt hearde nothing but the truth in that. For ſurely at Rome it is
<pb facs="tcp:13584:27"/>reported that hée did thoſe thinges which no man coulde haue doone, vnleſſe he had béen ſkilfull in Nicromancie: Hée fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde of the victorie of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and <hi>Dun de Auſtria,</hi> ouer the Turkes. Hée came alſo vp on a certaine time out of his ſtudie and tolde them of the victorie that were then in his preſence: Nowe, (quoth hée) the Turkes are vanquiſhed and ſlaine. Theſe wordes hée might foretell by Nigromancie, as I ſuppoſe, and not otherwiſe. For hée had not the gift of Propheſie being a Tyrant, and an open perſecutor of the truth. This <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Quintus</hi> was ſo welbeloued of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, that ſome of his Chamberlaines had beſméered his <hi>Crucifix</hi> with poyſon, ſo that when he came to pray, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to kiſſe the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> it ranne away: &amp; when he ſaw the <hi>Crucifix</hi> remoouing it ſelfe after that maner, he créeped néerer, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more hée créeped, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> farther the <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix</hi> remooued. This thing I thinke was doone by the Art of Nigromancie, but it was one of the myracles of his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Satan. But the <hi>Romans</hi> report him to haue béene familiar with God,
<pb facs="tcp:13584:27"/>and that hée very myraculouſly preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued hun alwayes, and cauſed the ſtones to certifie him of any iminent dangers. This man of ſinne was ſo bent to the hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenly treaſures, that hée cared not for worldly riches: for hée gaue all his goods to the poore, &amp; made them Noble men and Gentlemen: but they were ſuche poore as were his kinſmen, ſome of them Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins and Nephewes, to ſpeake plainely his baſtardes.</p>

               <p>It is ſo, as you ſay, that the Popes curſe can doe vs no hurte: but can you tell me (father) whether they are choſen Popes by the meanes of their
<pb facs="tcp:13584:28"/>vertue, learning, and wiſedome, or by the meanes of briberie, golde and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Panteleon.</speaker>
               <p>I haue tolde thée (my ſonne) that in the Popedome there is no vertue, and therfore it is the more lightly to be regarded. Learned they muſt néedes bée, not in Scriptures, for that they defie them, but in the Ciuile &amp; Canon lawes, that they may know what is their owne <hi>Iure illicito,</hi> &amp; may pleade for that which is not their owne <hi>Iure Pontificiali.</hi> Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is requiſite in a Pope, whereby he may knowe golde from ſiluer, gemmes and precious ſtones, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> common ſtones which bée in the ſtréetes. Hée muſt haue wiſedome to counte them, wiſedome to locke them vp in his treaſure houſe: hée cannot bée without wiſedome to picke out the beſt golde from the badde, to giue to his waiting gentlewomen at bed and boorde. Hée muſt moreouer haue wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to prouide for his baſtardely chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which hée begot whiles hee was a ſoule Prieſt to the <hi>Putanne</hi> in the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dello</hi> or whileſt hée ſaide Maſſe els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where for money, to ſupplie the neceſſitie
<pb facs="tcp:13584:28"/>of any ſober Curtezane, and defloured Virgin. Such learning and wiſedome, as before is recited, euery Pope muſte haue, and euery Gentleman. Bribery, large giftes, and greate promiſes muſt helpe him to that Papall dignitie, or els hée ſhall go without it, as moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it falleth out, vnleſſe perhaps ſome poore Cardinall be made Pope, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth with the colledge of Cardinals that the Papall reuenewes bée equally parted amongſt them all of the Colledge of Cardinals.</p>

This man brought ſo much money to Rome with him, from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as that hée was able therewithall to drawe and tempt vnto him, aſwell the wiſe and wary, as the
<pb facs="tcp:13584:29"/>ſimple ſort, to bée of his faction: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hée corrupted <hi>Creſtentius</hi> the Conſul, violently to abuſe Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> and to driue him out being a <hi>Germane,</hi> and ſo purchaſed the Popedome, and the ſequell thereof.

Before the Emperour <hi>Otho,</hi> in an open Synode, it was laide to his charge (as <hi>Lutherandus</hi> writeth in his ſixt booke) that hée neuer ſaide Mattins, that incelebrating the Maſſe he himſelfe had not communicated, that hée made Deacons in his ſtable among his Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that hée had committed inceſt with two harlots being his owne ſiſters, that hée played at Dice, prayed to the Diuell to ſend him good luck, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> for money he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted boy as to bée Biſhops, that he had rauiſhed virgins, and ſtrange women,
<pb facs="tcp:13584:29"/>that hée had made the holy pallance of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran,</hi> a Stewes &amp; Brothelhouſe, that hée had defloured <hi>Stephana</hi> his Fathers Concubine, and one <hi>Rainera</hi> a Widdow beſide one <hi>Anna</hi> another Widdowe, and her Néece: that hée had put out the eyes of <hi>Benedict</hi> his Ghoſtly father, that hee vſed common hauntes, that hée ware armour, and ſet houſes on fire, that hee braſt open dores &amp; windowes by might, that hée tooke a cup of wine and drunke to the Diuell, and neuer bleſſed him ſelfe with the ſigne of the Croſſe. Theſe and many more odious Articles, were laid to his charge: Whereupon the Emperour by the conſente of the Prelates depoſed him: and <hi>Leo</hi> the eight was ſet vp in his ſtéede. But ſo ſoone as the Emperour was gone, thoſe Harlots that had béene his companions, inueighed the Nobles of Rome, promiſing them the treaſures of the Church to depoſe <hi>Leo,</hi> and to place <hi>Iohn</hi> againe: which they did out of hand for deſire and couetouſneſſe of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church.

I will bring thée my friende to manie Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Popiſh Countries, where it is the Monkes and Friers cuſtome to practiſe the vices ſpecified by S. Paule, in the firſt Chapter to the <hi>Romans.</hi> At <hi>Shalome</hi> in <hi>Burgundie</hi> thrée Monks were taken in doing this déede, and were bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Citie. A <hi>German</hi> Prieſte, and a Frenche Prieſt of the Cathedrall Churche there, in the ſaide Citie, will not bée aſhamed to offer this villanie to ſtraungers that come to their houſes. This vice, and iniquitie aboundeth in moſt places amongſt the Monkes, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Prieſtes. At <hi>Troy,</hi> albeit by the Magiſtrates they are ſore puniſhed, for aſſociating themſelues to the company of lewde women, yet for all that, there is no woman but ſhée ſhall bée welcome to their bed and boord. I trauelled the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:13584:58"/>townes in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> in <hi>Anno, Dom. 1578.</hi> And I coulde come to no Monaſterie, but that I founde one or other in that Cloyſter hauing in his chamber a fayre wayting Gentlewoman. On a certaine time it fortuned, as I came to a Cloyſter in the Dolphine of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> to ſéeke ſome reliefe of the Prior of that Monaſterie, I met the Subprior, and hée demanding from whence I came, and whither I woulde wander, cauſed mée to come to his chamber, and there was in his bed a woman groning, as though ſhee had béene with childe. I was ſo bolde to aſke the Subprior what ſhée was, and hée an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, his ſiſter. I being a ſtranger and merily diſpoſed, I knowe by her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſaid I, and vnderſtand by her gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that your ſiſter is with child. Then ſpake the Subprior, and are you a Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that you vnderſtand ſo much by my ſiſter, that ſhée is conceaued? Yea mary doe I, quoth I, and I am a Phiſition. Then ſmiled the ſubprior, and ſaid, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my friende, thou art welcome, and bee thou aſſured of any friendſhip that I can ſhewe thée, thou haſt iudged right by this
<pb facs="tcp:13584:58"/>woman, ſhée is with childe, ſhée is not my ſiſter, but my Concubine, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturally deale with a woman, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnnaturally and Sodomittically defile my body with a man. Many of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the <hi>Benedicts,</hi> kéepe maid ſeruants to looke to their chambers, and to be their bedfellowes, and by that meanes they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyde the offence of pollution, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crime Sodomiticall: but my friende holde two franckes, goe to the butterie, take ſome meate, and goe forwardes in thy iourney, tell no body thoſe thinges which thou haſt ſéene and hearde. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramercie with all my hearte (quoth I) good maiſter Subprior, I will conceale whatſoeuer I haue heard and ſéene. At <hi>Lions</hi> in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> as I came to the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Saint <hi>Bridgit,</hi> crauing ſome reliefe, I found them very courteous, ſober, and quiet, and ſome of them ſo ſtill, that the braue youthes might doe with them as they would?

               <p>Truly good companion, theſe Monkes and Fryers are manifeſte hypocrites, and woe and ſorrowe ſhall bée their rewarde.

               <p>Muche more of the Lecherous liues of
<pb facs="tcp:13584:62"/>Monks and Nunnes hath this Poet <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellus</hi> written. <hi>Geraldus Cambrenſis</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the <hi>2.</hi> part of his worke, called the <hi>Glaſse of the Church,</hi> Cap. viii. that by the Sea Coaſt a ſhée fiſh was founde of a wonderfull greatneſſe, called a Thirle Poole. The people in great number came from al quarters there about, ſome to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the monſtrous ſhape of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fiſhe, and ſome to cut it in péeces &amp; to carry them home to their houſes, for ſome profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vſe. Among all other there was a Monke more quicke and ſtéering to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue all thinges then any other there: This monke drawing very néere to the fiſhe, behelde, viewed, and marked the priuie part thereof aboue all whiche (the hiſtorie ſaith) was as it had béene the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of a great doore or gate: hée looked thereupon very ſeriouſly, &amp; much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, neither coulde hée in any wiſe bee ſatiſfied with the ſight thereof: at the laſt without modeſtie, ſhame, and all baſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, hée approched ſomewhat nigh, that by the ſtime and fatneſſe thereof, whiche then lay vpon the ſande, his footing failed him and hée fell flat into
<pb facs="tcp:13584:62"/>the foule hole, ſo hée was ſwallowed vp of that which his lecherous hearte moſt deſired. This Adage then was founde true, ſuch Saint, ſuch ſhrine, ſuche béere, ſuch botell, and ſuch treaſure, ſuch truſt. Many ſuche vitious &amp; lecherous monkes coulde I recite, but becauſe I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theſe fewe may ſuffice the Reader, I paſſe them ouer, and referre the Reader to the hiſtories of euerie age, ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this monkiſh and ſolitarie life. When Antichriſt chiefly raigned in the conſciences of men, and when his doctrine repugnant againſt GOD his worde moſt flooriſhed in all quarters of Chriſtendome, yet God did raiſe vp ſome that boldly ſpake in publike aſſemblies, and with great boldneſſe wrote againſt the Pope and his poyſoned doctrine. In their bookes a man may reade howe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly and hypocritically the Papiſticall votaries liued. But louing companion I pray you tell mee howe doe the other monkes, Friers, and Nunnes, liue in the Countries, which you haue trauelled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Cities before ſpecified?</p>

<pb facs="tcp:13584:63"/>vnchaſtly and looſely, as I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of ſome alreadie. At <hi>Granoble</hi> in <hi>Fraunce</hi> there was an <hi>Auguſtinian</hi> Frier, who in his talke, apparrell, and geſture, in the preſence of the Citizens appeared very religious, godly, and deuout: but this man had no good fortune. For as he Sodomitically medled with a ſworne brother of his own profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hee was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken doing the déede: but this horrible fault being forgiuen vpon his deniall, hée was at an other time apprehended and impriſoned, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnder a rocke, nigh the foreſaid Citie <hi>Granoble</hi> hée crackt a louſe in a whoores Codyéece. At <hi>Shalome</hi> in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy</hi> there were two <hi>Dominica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> that were in outwarde conuerſation like Angels of heauen, but yet they loued the woman kinde ſo well, that they ſtudied more in making a Caue in a Rocke, not far from the Citie before mentioned, to entertaine two young queanes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they indeuoured to perfourme their Frierly vowe of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie. Their often walking from theyr Cloyſters, to theſe caues, bewrayed them at laſt, and made them infamous amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the Citizens. This thing was doone in
<pb facs="tcp:13584:63"/>the yéere of the Lorde, <hi>1578;</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie thereof was bruted in the Citie, at my being there.</p>

               <p>Oh my friend and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe traueller, haſt thou ſéene the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abuſes of theſe monſtrous and ougly hypocrites, and wilt thou not condemne their idolatrous doctrine, and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ceremonies, tending to the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all deſtruction both of body and ſoule? What do they profeſſe, but a religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by man, for his worldely gaine and honour, not conformeable to Gods worde, but agréeable to the Popes will and commaundement? What is their life, but Phariſaicall, iniurious, laſciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, lecherous, &amp; ſodomiticall? They talk of heauen, but they walke not to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, they bragge of chaſtitie, but they kéepe concubines, or els do much worſe: they defile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues one man w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> another they ſpeake of iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by good works, but they haue no good workes, but vice, as buggerry, adulterie, fornication, fraud, tyrannie, ambition, couetouſneſſe, and all vncharitableneſſe: they talke of Chriſt, but haue no experience of him, nor any
<pb facs="tcp:13584:64"/>acquaintance with him: they honour him with their lippes, but their hearte hungreth not after him: outwardly they profeſſe him, but inwardly they paſſe not for him: in the hearing of men they vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forſake the worlde, but in the ſight of men they imbrace the worlde. The Scripture calleth the worlde, as it is written in the firſt of Iohn. <hi>2.5.</hi> The ambition, the couetouſneſſe, the lechery, and all thoſe other thinges, that Sauour of nothing els but the fleſh: ſo that the fleſhe, the worlde, &amp; the Diuell, are thoſe thrée furies, that with their firebrands, and ſerpents, make an interming ling &amp; confuſion of all thinges. The fat bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied Monkes and Friers, that ſay they forſake the world, carry it with them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the monaſteries. For without doubt, it is not poſſible to ſée the worlde better than in the monaſteries, where a man ſhall ſée nothing els, but affections and paſſions of the minde, with the whiche they ſeeke to aduaunce themſelues, or to driue one another out of the doores. Oh that men will ſuffer themſelues to bee thus mocked and deluded, by theſe Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly
<pb facs="tcp:13584:64"/>ſhauelings, that indeuour as much as they may in deceiuing the people with counterfet holyneſſe, to liue like Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and to bée eſtéemed as Lordlinges. Oh that men ſhoulde credite theſe Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaicall hypocrites, that more regarde the pampering of their bodies, then the ſaluation of the ſoules of men, which is the end of our hope and faith, yea, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ende of our life in this life. Oh that men cannot ſée howe they fight againſte the Goſpel, and ſéeke to ouerthrow faith with ſuperſtition, couered with the cloke of true holyneſſe. Oh that men will not perceiue howe eache one of theſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous marked Friers trauelleth to ſéeke out ſome newe toy, therewith to drawe the common people vnto him, who are full of wandering. Doe they not ſée that they prepare newe faſhioned hoods, ſtrange and horrible Ceremonies, not ſéene in the worlde paſt, but reſerued to oppugne the truth of the Goſpell? What Chriſtian is hée that ſéeth not their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, that vnderſtandeth not their frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent ſuperſtition, wherwith the fooliſh people is inneigled? what true beléeuer
<pb facs="tcp:13584:65"/>of the Goſpel, thinketh, that to weare the wéede of S. <hi>Fraunces,</hi> or to goe clothed in that colour, is good againſt the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane Ague, and other diſeaſes, and (that worſe is) that to be buried in that habite, is the very right way to goe to heauen? And therefore that cunning man <hi>Longo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> leauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of a citizen of Rome, (in whoſe practiſe hée had ſo long labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) woulde bée laid in his graue a <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcane</hi> rather then a <hi>Romane.</hi> This ſelfe ſame honour had the Lord <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi</hi> in his head, <hi>Rodulphus Agricola,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther innumerable. But what néede ſo many wordes? Theſe Friers are come to that point, with that opinion of holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that they haue rid themſelues out of all other mens hands and authoritie, and haue brought all other men vnder their fée. Who knoweth not, that in olde times paſtil when learning and good ſtudies were layde a ſléepe, that all men held them for God Almighties kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? And eſtéemed more of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, then of the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. And they knewe not Chriſte, whom the Goſpell doth plainely
<pb facs="tcp:13584:65"/>ſet foorth vnto vs, which they kéepe in priſon. And ſith they onely had the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delyng of the booke of peace and libertie, the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people thought that they had taken all thinges out of that booke, and with curſed and abhominable lyes, they tooke out héere a péece, and there a péece, and with ſtrange &amp; fearefull myracles, and fayned dreames of Purgatorie, they kept the poore people in ſo great feare and woonder, that they were conſtrained to beléeue their wicked deuiſes and lyes.

Euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian (I am ſure) knoweth, that by the Diuels Rhetorike, they make the world beléeue too too many manifeſte faſhoods. and fooliſh toyes of the Diuels inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, theſe Monkiſhe fathers ſéeke to bee Iudges ouer them that are godlier then they themſelues, and leſſe ſpotted with any worldly affection: they haue the bare name of Saints and nothing els. Oh
<pb facs="tcp:13584:66"/>what a preſumptuous boldneſſe is this? to vſurpe the names of Saints, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that godly name to deceiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world? vnder the forme of an Angell of light, to worke all their deceites? their Coates, hoods, and ſundry colours, are deuiſed by the Diuell, to deceiue the worlde. For if they were the ſame that they woulde be counted, what néede ſhoulde there bée of ſuch diſguiſed garments? the which (ſay they) doe ſignifie that whiche they ought to bée. This is a cléere caſe, that while there is a ſhadow and ſignification of the thing, there is not the thing it ſelfe. If they were ſo in déede, then what ſhoulde they néed ſéek to be ſo in ſhew? outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are one thing, and inwardly ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Of ſuch the goſpel maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſaith, that there ſhall come wolues to deuour vs, cladde in ſhéepes ſkins, becauſe they will not bée knowne. For right well we know, that one ſhéepe eateth not an other. If theſe Monkes vſed not ſuch ſtrange garmentes, there ſhoulde not bée ſo many ſeduced from the truth.

               <p>I will tell thée of the iuggling of hypocriticall Friers eſpied at <hi>Orleance,</hi> as writeth <hi>Sleydane</hi> in his ix. booke of his Cronicles. In <hi>Orleance</hi> a Citie in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> it is not long ſince the Preſidents wife dyed, a noble and great woman, who ordained by her Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they ſhoulde carry her to bée buried without light, without Maſſes, and without any maner of pompe: and in déede ſhée was buried ſo in the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the Friers of Saint <hi>Fraunces.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none after they beganne to heare in that place horrible noyces, vntill one of thoſe Maſſemumblers turning his backe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, ſhewed them their rounde God made of dough. When this was once ſpread abroade, euery man was mooued, one ſaide hée heard it, one ſaid hée vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, and another ſaide hée ſawe all. The huſband hearing this, came thither himſelfe. Then doth the Coniurer binde
<pb facs="tcp:13584:67"/>the ſpirite to anſwere to his queſtions, and aſked it ſhée were in Paradice, and there was no anſwere made: hée aſked if ſhée were in hell, and yet there was no anſwere: he aſked if ſhe came from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, and then the ſpirite made a great ruſhing againſt the wall. Then did the Coniurer aſke, whether hée was ſuche a one, or ſuch a one, naming many and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie perſons that dyed long agoe, and yet there was no anſwere heard, nor no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of noyſe, but when hee named the woman y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> was buried without pompe, then the ſpirite made two great ruſhings againſt the wall, then did the Coniurer aſke whether ſhée were condemned for this or that cauſe: and in the end the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite ſaide, becauſe ſhée was a <hi>Lutheraue.</hi> Then was hearde thrée great ruſhes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wall. The huſband being a wiſe and circumſpect man, marked eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, and made as though hee had much maruelled at the matter, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thoſe wolues to Supper: and the day following, cauſed an hundred Maſſes to bée ſaide, and to light a whole worlde of candles. The wolues howled, they ſent
<pb facs="tcp:13584:68"/>their Gods into Purgatorie, wet the graue with vnholy water, and perfumed it with Frankinſence: and when this was doone, carried the Friers into din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in the meane ſeaſon ſent the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to the place where this deceit was doone, where they found certaine vautes and there within were thrée ſpirites hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom they tooke &amp; carried away. But howe coulde they doe this conſidering that they are ſpirites and no bodies?</p>

               <p>That is ſoone anſwered. For theſe were of thoſe ſpirits that haue bodies, of whome Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and of which ſorte almoſt all thoſe that dwell in Monaſteries are.</p>

In <hi>Turine</hi> alſo of late, the like matter hath béen ſéene
<pb facs="tcp:13584:68"/>well, the officers hauing found the bugs that made them a feard, lead them away like thrée little Diuels (as they were) into the place, where the other great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels were at meat, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they knew their knauery bewrayed, as men all dumbe, they began to looke one vpon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and with ſhame enough were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed afterwardes and rewarded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their demerites.</p>

               <p>At <hi>Verſillis,</hi> a notorious falſe Frier deſirous to get money, vnder colour of religion, entiſed a rich widdow, and carried her away with him to <hi>Naples</hi> and from thence to other Cities and Townes. At <hi>Verona</hi> a Citie in <hi>Italie,</hi> in the yéere of our Lorde, <hi>1578.</hi> There was a falſe théeſe, a Frier of the order of the <hi>Minorites Franciſcanes,</hi> that hadde put into the heades of the fooliſh women this opinion, that they muſt giue to the Churche the tenth of al things, and euen in like maner, the tenth night as they doe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their huſbands. In a Monaſterie not farre from <hi>Paleſtro,</hi> there was a Monke named <hi>Padre Franciſco,</hi> that loued laced mutton ſo well, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oftentimes he woulde take the bridles bit in his mouth, &amp; cauſe his Iillian to kicke him with her féete, and then hée woulde gallop as though he had béene a horſe: But ſurely not as wiſe as a horſe. At <hi>Vigleuano</hi> in <hi>Lombardie, 1578.</hi> There was a <hi>Dominican</hi> preacher, that was counted vertuous, learned, and

                  </gap>toutly he rebuked vice, and in preaching maintayned vertue. But from ſuche hypocriticall Saints, <hi>libera nos Domine.</hi> This <hi>Dominican</hi> Frier, at euening time, would repaire to his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame profeſſion, and the Prior or Subprior, with ſome other of the ſociety, alwayes would kéepe him company to the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery of Saint <hi>Brigit,</hi> and there this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman Frier, with the reſt of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, woulde ſhriue the Nunnes in the darke. Their kiſſing and vngodly beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, their vnchaſte woords, &amp; vnſéeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handeling eche other, were demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratiue tokens of their incontinencie.

            <p>Theſe Friers and Nunnes obſerue the ſaying of <hi>Bennet,</hi> who taught his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples if they could not liue chaſtly, then to worke cloſly. Theſe Monkes abrode in the ſight of the worlde looke as though they cared for no women, but in the darke, with <hi>Iilian</hi> and <hi>Ione,</hi> they loue good iumbling, they dread not God that ſitteth aboue, <hi>For all is but play, and as they do ſay, the night muſt vade away.</hi> This <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> preacher I am ſure, with the reſt of his company, in the face of the worlde appeared as ſaintes: the woordes they ſpake ſauoured of holineſſe, in geſture, in countenance, &amp; in outward appearaunce, they were as Angels, holy, &amp; holy, &amp; dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble holy, and more then holy: they blinded the people with their counterfeit ſhewe of holineſſe, and made them ſelues to bee honoured amongſt the ſilly people as god almighties kinſmen. This <hi>Dominican</hi> preacher, with the Biſhops ſecretarie, in my preſence ful off woulde vſe Sodomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall woordes. It is not poſſible almoſt to ſpeake of that honeſtly, which both preacher &amp; ſecretary ſo vnhoneſty ſpake and did. I was aſhamed to heare their
<pb facs="tcp:13584:71"/>beaſtly talke, but they were ſhameleſſe to vtter ſuch ribauldrie. The like in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land I neuer heard, &amp; God graunt I may neuer heare the like. In another <hi>Auguſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> monaſterie of that citie, I was well acquainted, and beloued alſo of many, ſo that in going with them to the Nunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I ſawe many horrible practiſes, and deteſtable abuſes amongſt them, which ſhamefaſtnes doth forbidde me to receite. An <hi>Auguſtian</hi> confeſſour, hauing heard the confeſſion of a <hi>Flemming,</hi> inioyned him in his pennance, that hee ſhoulde viſite <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donna diloreto,</hi> and offer his gift at her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; craue her interceſſion to her ſonne Ieſus Chriſt: In the meane while, this incontinent and vnchaſte Fryer ſleapt with his wife, and being taken naked in bedde by the officers of the Citie: they let him go to his monaſterie w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>out any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was a graue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; eloquent preacher. At <hi>Auſpurgh</hi> in <hi>Germanie,</hi> there was a monke that craued leaue of his ſuperiours, to viſite the holye ſepulchre at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and at <hi>Venice.</hi> As I was lodged with him at <hi>Realto,</hi> at the ſigne of the <hi>George,</hi> I fel in acquaintance with him, and he made me priuie of his

At <hi>Bolognia</hi> I mette with a Frier and an Nunne, that tooke their Pilgrimage to <hi>Madonna diloreto:</hi> this Fryer called this Nun his wife in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> viteling houſes where hee came: for he traueiled like a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſhe like a Gentlewoman. For they had put off their frierly and Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh weede. I went with them euen to that idole of <hi>Madonna,</hi> kept them compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, &amp; ſaw howe in our iourney one bedde ſerued them twaine. This Frier verye craftely couered his head with a great
<pb facs="tcp:13584:72"/>coife, that his ſhauen crowne might not bee ſeene. How when we came to <hi>Madon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na diloreto,</hi> (a little before they changed their garmentes) they went in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed weedes, and were as deuout in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mans iudgement, as ſaint <hi>Frances</hi> and ſaint <hi>Clare.</hi> Howe they returned home I can not tell, for I bare them company no longer. At <hi>Serauallis</hi> I mette a <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> whome acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a braue <hi>Italian</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhee called brother: theſe two ſlept in one chamber, &amp; what they did, I cannot tell, but ſurely I ſawe right well in the fields that vnder a hedge they played as man and wife. I was a meere ſtraunger, and therefore they had the leſſe feare to doe what they woulde. I kept them company foure dayes, &amp; all that while both brother and ſiſter did as man and wife woulde haue done in ſecrete. It is no newes to heare howe that Monkes and Fryers in their Pilgrimage, reſorte to the <hi>Brothell</hi> houſes: for it is a common thing amongſt them. At <hi>Pauia</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> there was a <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine,</hi> that aſked leaue of his ſuperiours to viſite <hi>Madonna di loreto,</hi> &amp; a Nun like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe craued licence of her Prioreſſe, to

A fryer out of <hi>Cicilia</hi> came in deuotion to <hi>Madonna di loreto</hi> likewiſe, with a ſtolen Nunne from his countrey, as I came from <hi>Madonna di loreto</hi> in vrbin a citie in <hi>Italie,</hi> I mette this luſtie fryer with Itli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an his louing ſaint, whome hee woulde néedes haue in his bedde to pray vnto: his ſhauen crowne was couered with a coife, that hee might bee taken for a temporall man, for ſo he would ſeem to be, although he was not.

               </hi> Fryer was impriſonned, for that he had ſlaine a man. This frier (by report) was a preacher, and of vnchaſte liuing, hee had ſlayne either two or thrée, &amp; yet was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer executed, the fact being wilfull: belike
<pb facs="tcp:13584:73"/>hee had ſome good friendes, otherwiſe he had ſuffered as malefactour &amp; Homicide.

If they couet to ſatiſfie their carnall appetite, if they couet to ſteale, if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to fare delicately, if they intende to raunge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrey fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place to place, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt they fayne to their Abbots, or Pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they haue vowed to viſit either <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donna di loreto,</hi> or the ſepulchre of the Lorde at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> or the place where ſaint <hi>Frauncis</hi> bodie hangeth in the ayre, not touching the earth, but miraculouſly hanging between the firmament and the earth, wearing a golden ring on his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which a Pope of Rome in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement gaue him to put on. And in that place (ſay the Pilgrime Papiſtes) remayneth his bodye vncorrupted, béeyng there fiue hundreth yéeres at leaſt. Or elſe the Friers and Monkes
<pb facs="tcp:13584:73"/>goe on Pilgrimage to the Tumbe of S. <hi>Andrew</hi> the Apoſtle, out of which floweth cléere oyle, profitable to heale many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. The Nunnes obtaine leaue to the like places, and on the way they méete their Paramours, whom in curtezane (curteous I would ſay) maner they kiſſe and licke with ſtretched out tongue, and white lilie lippes. They vſe ſuch daliance one with the other, as I am lothe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. Their ſongues ſauour of nothing elſe but ribauldry, and abhomination. God graunt them repentance, and make them his ſeruantes: for ſurely they doe amiſſe, &amp; violate their oth, breake Gods holy commaundement, and woonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſe his diuine Maieſty. They would be counted holy Virgins, and deuoute fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, albeit they are painted ſepulchers, and vitious hypocrites. At <hi>Millan</hi> there were two Monkes that ſo hated Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Brhomeo,</hi> for that hée endeuoured to reforme their looſe liuing, that as this Cardinall was at Maſſe, one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a dagge towardes him. But as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune fauoured this Cardinall, the bullet flew vnder his arme, and was not found
<pb facs="tcp:13584:74"/>betwéene his ſhirt and his ſkinne, as hée that wrote in his booke of the diſcouery of <hi>Iohn Nichols</hi> falſly reporteth. For at <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> the Cardinals confeſſour tolde mée the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. Surely it was a weake bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, weaker then a bullet of paper, that could not pearcethrough his body, hauing no other thing for defence, but his thinne Garmentes about him. Hee that ſhooted towardes him, was not farre from the place where he ſaide Maſſe. Therefore it is an vntruth, that the bullet was found betwixt his ſkinne and his ſhirt.

My bed was very harde, and my ſhéetes were ſomewhat ſcabbed: yet durſt I not ſpeake boldly, and ſaye, that I was ſore miſuſed. But I healde my peace, and when I ſaw them angry, I did what I could to content their mindes by paying them more then was their due.

               <p>To tell thee the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of theſe Ieſuites, I think it be but loſt labour: foraſmuch as <hi>Maiſter Hanmer</hi> hath ſo diſplayde their originall and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, their vowe and othe, their hyyocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and ſuperſtition, with their docttrine &amp; poſitions, that to ſpeake more thereof, (excepte of that whiche I haue ſéene and heard) I thinke it but vanitie. Thou aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt me how they liue? I aunſwere (as conference, familiaritie, &amp; acquaintance taught me) they liue ſpotted with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, they pretend holineſſe, but woorke wickedneſſe. For they haue fayned a newe profeſſion, a newe and ſtrange ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, neuer heard of before. They were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to be named Chriſtians, and for this cauſe they called themſelues Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, that is of Ieſu. And why? becauſe they vamely perſuade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfect &amp; abſolute holines co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in their ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty only.

Why ſaye the Monkes, and Friers, doe the Ieſuites arrogantly preſume to ſay, that they are onelie of the ſocietie of Ieſus, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?

<pb facs="tcp:13584:77"/>Ieſuites, becauſe they are compartuers with Ieſu in ſaluing. O proud and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Luciferlike monſters. O wretched creatures.

What mooued you (you blinde creatures) to forgette your owne ſtate, and miſerable condition? What did you thinke by this title to be magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed héere in this world?

But yet, albeit he was (as farre as I ſurmiſe, by his fooliſh vowes, rogiſhe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrinations, &amp; lewd practiſes in many countries) impudently diſpoſed &amp; naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily bent to peruert good manners, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh groſſe errours in the Synagogue of Sathan, and beſides that, buſily occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in preferring manye ſuperſtitious ceremonies: yet they ſhould not diſdaine after his name to be termed <hi>Ignatians</hi> or <hi>Layolans,</hi> becauſe they acknowledge and follow him as their Patrone in doing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his doctrine, councell, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes. For as they obey his will, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:13584:78"/>ſhould they acknowledge his name, and think no ſkorne, to be called therby as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name Ieſus, it is not for their mowing, neither ought they to deſire the honour due to ſo great a title and name of Ieſus: contrary to the godly meaning of all true Chriſtians. Surely (louing companion <hi>Triſander</hi>) there is ſuch enimity betwéen the Monkes and the Ieſuites, (I ſpeake not this of malice, but of experience) that greater is hardly to bee found betwéene the Turke and the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Monks neuer report wel of the Ieſuites, and the Ieſuites neuer ſpeake well of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> monks. From cardinal <hi>Brhomeo,</hi> there came Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites oftentimes to my Lord Biſhops houſe of <hi>Vigleuano,</hi> now there were two Dominicans in his houſe, that alwayes denyed to kéepe them company, for this cauſe only ſayd they, for that they were Hypocrites. I wayted at their table, and marked their behautour, they woulde drink but once at one meale, they would vſe ſuch Ceremonies about the Cups with croſſing, double croſſing, and mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling I cannot tell what, that it would make a man to woonder. But at the firſt
<pb facs="tcp:13584:78"/>time I was ſo wearie in holding the cup, and not knowing the meaning of their Ceremonies in bleſſing the cup, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I took it from them, and left them thirſty and dry, vntill I was taught yea with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of my yll maners, in taking the cup before they had drunk) to ſtay with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cup vntil they had quenched their thirſt, The Ieſuites muſt haue patience if any thing once be denied to them, they muſt not ſéeke it twiſe, they eate but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at a meale, they are nouriſhed (ſay they) by dayly contemplation, and the Angel féedeth them aſſoone as they dyne or ſup, after thanksgiuing to GOD, and our bleſſed Lady, as the manner of the Papiſtes is, and after waſhing of their handes, they goe to the Temple, &amp; there they knéele before a duſtie image: there is ſuche crying and knocking on their breſtes, that oftentimes I was afrayde their heartes ſhoulde haue leapte out of their Bodies. There was ſuche howling, and ſuche wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that teares as bigge as milſtones came out of their eyes. <hi>Bleſſed Marie</hi> (quoth
<pb facs="tcp:13584:79"/>
                  <hi>pardon me, for I haue offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded thee, not only in thought but woorde, and deede.</hi> Oh <hi>helpe me holy ſaint with ſpeede, thy ſweete ſonne Ieſus Chriſt alſo, I haue offended alas for wo, but through thy interceſſion, he will forgiue my tranſgreſſion, and</hi> as I hope <hi>will fauour me, and pardon mine iniquities.</hi> Then hée knocketh his breaſt, and boweth his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to kiſſe the grounde. Bleſſed Ladie quoth the other, pray ſo, mee to the Lord Ieſu thy louing ſonne. For I am a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and therefore I ſay <hi>ora pro me pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore, O beata Maria, mater vnigenti:</hi> O bleſſed Marie, the mother of the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, pray for mée a ſinner. This, and ſuch like prayers doe the Ieſuites vſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Image of <hi>Marie</hi> the mother of Chriſt; they goe from image to image, from ſtocke to ſtone, from poſte to pillar, and paſſe by no image but they touch it with their beades, and kiſſe it with their mouthes. If they find a rotten poſte, they thinke immediatly that ſome ſaint was bounde to the ſame to bee ſcourged. If there appeare vppon the pillers the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a mouſe, forthwith they woulde imagine it to bee the picture of a Saint,
<pb facs="tcp:13584:79"/>and therfore they will kneele before thoſe pillers, &amp; adore them, with kiſſing them, and bowing their bodies before them. Doubtles the Ieſuites are very ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, &amp; from them (as from a founraine) floweth all kinde of Idolatrie and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. Let the Monkes and Friers beare witneſſe of this, let <hi>Balaams</hi> marks beare recorde of my woordes. There is ſuche brawling &amp; chiding oftentimes amongſt the Ieſuites, and the Monkes, in Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Browmeo</hi> his houſe at <hi>Millan,</hi> that greater can not lightly bee amongſt two ſcoldes: firſt there is a queſtion moued, then in the anſwere to the ſame there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth great contention: one diſprayſing ech others inſufficiencie &amp; defect of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſometimes eche one ſeeketh to excel the other, with vaine bragges of their life and conuerſation. The Ieſuites, more boldely then wiſely, ſay that their life is Angelicall, and ſpotted with no ſpotte of iniquitie. The thing which wée promiſe (ſay they) we performe, we vowe chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and wée kéepe it: wee neuer haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe vnto women, we neuer haue confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with them, wée neuer come in their
<pb facs="tcp:13584:80"/>ſight, and if they come to talke with vs, wée auoyde their companie, by whiche meanes all occaſion of carnall copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is cleane cut off, and ſo is our vowe kept, and neuer violated. Theſe words of the Ieſuites are but bragges, the truth inſinuateth the contrarie. For at <hi>Venice, Ann. do. 1580.</hi> a Ieſuite was found in bed with a Curtezane, or (as in Engliſhe I may terme her) with a common ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet: what he did in bedde with her I can not tel, for that certaine venecians at my lodging, at the ſigne of Saint <hi>George</hi> at <hi>realto</hi> told me that a Ieſuite and a curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zane were founde in bedde together, they told mée not that they were both take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in doing the déed, but found in bed, as I ſaid. Alac good Ieſuite, I thinke hée came to bed to his ſiſter, to giue her ſome ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfort and to heare her confeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in aſhaking ague. I dare ſay the yong gentleman Ieſuite meant no hurt in the worlde, vnleſſe perhappes wée thinke it hurt, that hée ventered to bée in one bedde with her, without conſent of his rectour: or elſe that hée endeuoured to gette a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie boy by one that was a laye woman,
<pb facs="tcp:13584:80"/>and a ſtrumpet, and not by ſome nun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpirituall ſiſter, but yet a common woman, and common aſwel to Monkes, as to Ieſuites. At <hi>Millan,</hi> as it was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto mée by a Bargameſco Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Cathedral Church, there was a luſtie ſtout Ieſuite that loued to haunte the ſtewes verie well. And that the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites violate their vnlawfull vowe of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, theſe examples following may te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie. At <hi>Auſpurgh</hi> late in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euening there was a Ieſuite founde with his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that reſorted to a ſuſpitious &amp; defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med houſe of harlottes. When they came into the houſe, they told the miſtreſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe that they brought with them holye water to ſprinckle about in euery cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to the expulſion of Diuelles, that through their abſence they might doe as they woulde, &amp; that their offence might not bée knowen vnto the Diuell, and therefore not like to bée puniſhed. But theſe holy fathers, when they had ſprinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all their coniured water, they were rapt in loue with two queanes of the houſe, and becauſe they had no money, they gaue their bookes vnto the haudie
<pb facs="tcp:13584:81"/>drabs, that they ſhould accompliſh their venereal luſte and carnall concupiſcence. In the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> monaſterie, I hearde this of trueth by thrée monkes. At <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> a citie in <hi>Italie</hi> the like thing happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned betweene two Ieſuites, who coulde not for all their meditations and deuine contemplations, brydle the luſtes of their fieſh: theſe were taken in the ſtewes late in the euening, and beeing examined what they did there, they anſwered that they gaue good exhortations, to the ende that they might bée conuerted from curtezanes vnto Nunnes.</p>
               <p>Better is a bad excuſe then none. Thus they were diſmiſſed, and their intent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, albeit it was ſuſpicious that the Ieſuites were nought, ſéeing that they were found abroad ſo late, &amp; alſo with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but let this matter paſſe. I know not their inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whether it was to begette two boyes to make them in time to become ſoule prieſtes to ſay maſſe for their ſoules, or els to begette two wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that in time they might become Nunnes to ſerue the gréedie néede and fleſhly deſire of them of their ſocietie. I
<pb facs="tcp:13584:81"/>tell thée not (good friende <hi>Triſander</hi>) what is the chiefeſt cauſe of the Ieſuites Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to <hi>Madonna di loreto,</hi> no other cauſe then to viſite this idole and to ſerue theyr incontinencie, their youthful toyes, being not as yet ſet apart. I haue béene in their company, and therfore with leſſe feare I may reporte of them, they would neuer remaine in anye other lodging, except in ſuche, where they might finde Italian mares redie, and eaſie to be ride<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that was ſo ſober that euery man might handle her as he woulde, they bowed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ſaint, and made their offrings vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, they loued a ſaint with wanton lookes and rouling eyes, better (I am ſure) then <hi>Madonna di loreto.</hi> Theſe Ieſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes while they are in their perigrination, are <hi>Venus</hi> lulibie babes, and her ſweete darlings, they loue to play with women, they are ſo laſciuious, luxurious, &amp; viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that they regarde not howe lewdlye they behaue them ſelues, ſo that their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite bée changed, and their perſons vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. Theſe exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples recited may ſerue to daunt the pride, and coole the vanting brags of wicked and lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tious Ieſuites.
<pb facs="tcp:13584:82"/>They haue eares more vigilant to heare themſelues prayſed, then a purpoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to deſerue prayſe. If it bée poſſible that fyre might bee voyde of heate, then may the Ieſuites kéepe themſelues chaſte from women. For howe much ſo euer they puniſhe their fleſhe, yet can that ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſſe be neuer expelled. <hi>Naturam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellas furca, licet vſque recurret.</hi> I will not ſayth Chriſt, <hi>Matth. 19.</hi> that all men vnderſtande this woorde, but hée which can vnderſtande it, let him vnderſtand it. therefore the Ieſuites are worthie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, that vowe chaſtitie, and can not kéepe it.</p>

               <p>The Ieſuites are hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and though they carnally knowe fourty women, yet they ſay they are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſanctified virgins.

Theſe Ieſuites, for all their graue and fatherly lookes, do fixe their vnhoneſt loue in fleſhely filthineſſe, and like the beaſts of the fielde lie wallowyng in the myre, they take great delight, by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confeſſion, to make a ſpoyle or pray of maydes and wiues: againſt theſe Ieſuites, vnleſſe they repent, the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gates are ſhut for euer, to exclude them out, for their rewarde is appoynted in darkeſome hel, there to remaine amongſt the curſed reprobate.

God conuert their heartes, and make them penitent: I wiſh them well to do.

               <p>As I gather by the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of <hi>Hieroſolomitanus</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pilgrime, &amp; by the report of the <hi>Turkes</hi> themſelues, with whome I haue had conference at <hi>Venice,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13584:84"/>eſpecially for ſuche matters, to knowe what religious votaries they had. It is this in the hyſtorie of this Pilgrime I haue read, and the <hi>Turkes</hi> with whome I ſpake, confirmed the ſame, that there bée two ſortes of religious votaries, the one is of them that dwell in Cloiſters, where <hi>Magicall</hi> Arte is taught, who when they haue béene Nouices two or thrée yéeres, then they are taken to bée members of that Cloiſter, and are bounde to pray for the Emperours good ſucceſſe in all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. The Emperours of the <hi>Turkes</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes conſulte with theſe Monkes, touching the ſtate of his Empire, they foretel him what miſhap is like to chance in his enterpriſes, and prognoſticate the euent of all his procéedinges. Theſe Monkes neuer departe out of their cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, except vpon ſome great and vrgent occaſion. This order is not farre vnlike to the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> order, for they are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſéene out of their cloiſters. An other order is of them that goe a begging from doore to doore, with great beades aboute their armes and crye <hi>Allah Mahomet ſaue you good dame and good maiſter, I wil pray
<pb facs="tcp:13584:84"/>for the ſoule of your fathers and mothers and of your Grandſiers, allah bleſſe you little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. We ſee</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that theſe children of yours are like to come to high degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> This pilgrime who liued fourtéene yeeres at leaſt as captiue amongeſt theſe <hi>Turkes,</hi> in his hiſtorie maketh mention of their begging from houſe to houſe: ſuche flattering I thinke they vſe, as theſe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites doe, when they are commaunded to goe a begging. Theſe Monkes are like the Ieſuites in ſuperffition, and idolatry, Theſe <hi>Turkiſhe</hi> Monkes neuer goe a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, but when their rectour, or their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoſt commandeth them. So the Ieſuites in like manner, when they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by their generall or rectour to goe a begging, they muſt needes obey, yea, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte hee be a preacher, a confeſſour, a publique profeſſour of diuinitie, or phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, or of any other ſcience, if hée bée commaunded to take wallet and bottle, hée muſt néedes doe it, and may not denie, vnleſſe hée will incurre his ſuperiours diſpleaſure. Father <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; father <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> Ieſuites of the Engliſh Seminarie tolde me, that the vicegenerall, being a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:13584:85"/>man borne of moſt noble parentage, was commanded at his firſte enteraunce into the ſocietie of Ieſus, to carrie a baſket to bée ſolde, which baſket being not woorth vi.d. He was willed notwithſtanding to receiue no leſſe then a crowne, and as for his dinner hée ſhoulde begge it at other mens houſes abroad in the citie of Rome. This man being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to goe &amp; ſel his baſket, did ſo, and as hée ſought to ſell it, being very olde and rotten, all men laughed him to ſkorne, and when they knewe the price, which hee demaunded for the baſket, they derided him the more, and cryed, what meaneſt thou, thou ſoole, to ſéeke v.s. for thy baſkette, béeing not worth v..d. This thing was done by his ſuperiours to proue his pacience and to try how wel he would frame himſelfe to their orders, as this Nouice, being ſometimes a Lorde by byrth, and riche in poſſeſſions, ſuffered himſelf to bée laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all ſortes of people, and as hée went about the marked places of Rome, and walked in euery ſtreet, hée met by chance with one, that in time paſt had béene his ſeruaut: this Nouice Ieſuite knew him
<pb facs="tcp:13584:85"/>not, but this man that had béene his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt in time paſt, knewe the ſaide No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice Ieſuite verye well, and ſaining as though hée had not knowen him, he came vnto him, &amp; aſked him the price of his baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. This Nouice anſwered v.s. then hée that had béene his ſeruaunt, gaue him v.s according to his owne demaunde. And when this Nouice Ieſuite had added moreouer, that hée was commaunded to ſéeke his dinner abroad, then this man inuited him to dinner. The duke of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans</hi> ſonne and heire, was inchaunted by theſe Ieſuites to forſake his father, his mother, and all the fréendes that hée had, yea, &amp; to renounce his inheritaunce that ſhoulde haue befallen into his handes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deceaſe of his father. This noble youth, tobecome a Ieſuite, regarded no worldly wealth, nor princely promotion. But this young Gentleman was abuſed very much, as you may heare as follow eth. They cauſed him, not only to practiſe the arte of begging, but alſo to ſaſt, and to whippe himſelfe ſo often, hauing ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect to his tender and féeble ſtate of bodie, by reaſon of his delicate educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:13584:86"/>on and bringing vp: neither yet to his vnaccuſtomed manner, in ſo chaſtiſing him beyonde al reaſon and meaſure, that he fell into a pitifull conſumption, in ſo much that being worne and conſumed to the bare bones, he died. The parentes in ſundrye Cities of <hi>Italie</hi> crie out againſt theſe new ſect of Ieſuites, for they ſeduce their children to their ſect, and with their flattering woordes, fatre ſpéeches, and large promiſes of great giftes at Chriſts handes, in the heauenly citie <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> they deceiue and corrupt the towardely diſpoſitions of many a youth, to vertue and Chriſtian religion, and abuſe them vnto all vngodlyneſſe and hereſies. In Rome, <hi>Anno domi. 1579.</hi> There was a young Gentleman of great reputation amongſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> this man beeyng heire to his father deceaſed, was bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched with ſuch an immoderate deſir to be a Ieſuite, that neither his mother nor any freinde that hee had, coulde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to the contrary.</p>
               <p>At laſt he was admitted into the ſocietie of Ieſuites, and being amongeſt the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, his mother made earneſt ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:13584:86"/>vnto the Pope, that her ſonne being commaunded by his holineſſe letters, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected vnto the generall, might bée be put out of their ſocietie, and might returne vnto her, and peaceably inioy that which his father had bequeathed him in his laſt will and Teſtament. Now as ſhée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of the Pope, to haue her ſonne releaſed, &amp; ſet frée from the ſocietie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu, ſo it came to paſſe. But yet the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites hauing acceſſe vnto the youngma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo incenſed his minde with the loue of their profeſſion, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> being kept for a ſpace in a cloſe chamberr vnder a falſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged pretence of looking for his ſhyrt to bée made warme before the fire, hée conueied himſelfe out of the chamber, and came directly to the Ieſuites Colledge. Of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch coulde I make rehear all, but the time doth not permit, nor my leaſure doth ſuffer me to ſay more hereof, then is alreadie ſaide.</p>

I woulde to God they framed their liues according to the will of God. They deſerue more glory at Chriſt his handes, ſay theſe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiticall helhoundes then the Angels do: they merits the kingdome of heauen of their owne workes. What ſhall I ſpeake of their erronious doctrine, ſéeing many, both learned and veriuous, haue
<pb facs="tcp:13584:91"/>written at large thereof. And therfore I paſſe it ouer, the rather becauſe their pernicious doctrine is well knowne, and publiſhed to the world in print. But bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Diawinck.</hi> can you tell whether they ſay they haue any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference wiſh Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Tuſh man, what ſpeake you of conference, ſeeing that our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Ladie as you knowe bringeth them, as they are ſléeping, both bed and all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, and in their dreames they talke as familiarly with Chriſte as Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binhood, and William of Clowdeſly. All their talke with Chriſt is in dreames &amp; viſions, &amp; I think euer will be. There talked once with mée a Ieſuite, trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to <hi>Madonna di loreto,</hi> who tolde mée, that Chriſte is a viſion appeared vnto him, and ſaide, that hée ſhoulde prooue a notable Philoſopher, well eſtéemed of all men, and therfore ſaid this Ieſuite, this <hi>Ariſtoles</hi> booke which you ſée, I carty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with mée. Then I aſked him, why rather hée brought not with him the book of the new Teſtament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then anſwered this Ieſuite, <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> booke is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde and learned then the booke of the
<pb facs="tcp:13584:91"/>newe Teſtament. Thus wée ſée, that the booke of an Heathen philoſopher, is more eſtéemed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt theſe Ieſuites, then the booke of the newe Teſtament, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nothing els in it, but the heauenly veritie. Had not the Rector of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Colledge at Rome, ſéene in a viſion our bleſſed lady come to him, telling him he ſhould be a Ieſuite, he had neuer (as he thinketh) béen a Ieſuite, nor rector of that Colledge. He that faineth beſt, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in hypocriſie, ſhalbe in great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation amongſt this new order of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites. Héere in this place I ſurceaſe to ſpeake of the Ieſuites any more. Nowe wil I ſpeake a word or two touching the <hi>Theatines.</hi> The <hi>Theatines</hi> are a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men, who differ nothing in habite fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ieſuites: their ſhurt ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds are ſcarce to bée ſéene, ſo are the Ieſuites: their gownes are ſomtimes of one colour, and ſometimes of another.

                  <pb facs="tcp:13584:92"/>goeth neuer a begging, but al things neceſſary for prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are broght to their houſes, I haue béen at their monaſteries &amp; haue had ſuch good chéere, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is not to be gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They haue wine ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; al other things in great abundance. Now becauſe this generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is obſcure &amp; vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the world, therfore to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> famous, is not mine inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but this I ſay, that theſe Ieſuites, &amp; theſe <hi>Theatines</hi> are in great emulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the one ſpeaketh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil of the other, the one enuieth the other. There is no difference almoſt betwéene the Ieſuites, &amp; the <hi>Theatines.</hi> I woulde ſpeak more abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly of this order of the <hi>Theatines,</hi> if our Engliſh men were any whit moleſted by the name &amp; ſect therof. God be thanked, England knoweth not what they be, &amp; by me ſurely at this time England ſhall not know what they are. The reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſtate of this our miſerable time, wherin ſo many ſects &amp; ſo many vowed orders of vaine profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds abound, doth driue a maruellous ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row &amp; griefe into me, who haue ſéene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I bewaile &amp; lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t their caſes. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the pitifull plight of theſe our wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb facs="tcp:13584:92"/>daies, what true Chriſtian is there, but wil powre out a fountaine of teares, to bewaile the calamitie therof. The ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of our aduerſaries is exceeded ſo farre that it withdraweth ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s expectation to looke for amendement, vnles God of his great mercie doe worke ſupernaturally the reſtitution. Againe none might nowe double his exclamation, in theſe dayes as <hi>Seneca</hi> reporteth, which is: <hi>good life, lawe, good order, godlines, &amp; faith are now decaied.</hi> Therefore, calling to my remembrance this our carefull caſe, I muſed with my ſelfe what might bée the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſodenly came to my remembrance the comfortable promiſes of God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, made to the kéepers of his lawes and commaundementes: and likewiſe I conſidered his intollerable threatninges to the breakers of the ſame. Then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the wretchedneſſe of our liues to the ſinceritie of his holy preceptes, I finde a marueilous difference. Good life was neuer in ſuch contempt, malice at no time bare ſuch rule, the godly neuer more diſpiſed, and finally, God neuer more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, nor the Catholike faith at any
<pb facs="tcp:13584:93"/>time had in ſo litle regarde, eſpecially of ſuch as of arrogancie chalenge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the name of true Chriſtians, who in very déede are vtterly voide of all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie. To theſe the wordes of Chriſt may be well applied, where he ſayth in the <hi>9.</hi> Chap. <hi>15.</hi> If I had not come vnto them, they ſhoulde haue had no ſinne in them, but now their ſinne doth remaine. Which words are verily verified in thoſe falſe Chriſtians, which did erre not onely in faith, but alſo in all other pointes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and yet obſtinatly ſéeme to defende their religion. They will not yeelde to ſcripture, they wil not conſent to reaſon, they will not acknowledge the trueth. It is by nature giuen to men, in ſome things to erre, but to perſiſt therein is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature. For (ſaith <hi>Tullie Lib. 1.</hi>) Wée bée al drawen and led to aſpire vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to knowledge, wherein to paſſe other we thinke it a goodly matter: but to ſlide, to erre, to bée ignorant, to bée deceiued, wée count it euill and diſhoneſt. Therefore ſaith hée, one thing is to be auoided there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which is, that we take not things that we know not, as though we knew them,
<pb facs="tcp:13584:93"/>and raſhly aſſent to them. Wherefore, deliberation and aduertiſment is to bée required in ſuch cauſes. Nowe then it is the office and duetie of man, to apply his will to the grace of God, by whom truth is reueiled in time, wherevnto hée ought to conſent: The ſerpent <hi>Hydra,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whom <hi>Hercules</hi> fought, had not ſo many heades, as each of theſe ſerpents had deuiſed opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: nor yet <hi>Ixion</hi> begate ſo many <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taurs,</hi> as theſe monſters imagined here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies: inſomuch that vpon one point, which is the chiefeſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort left here vpon earth, there are <hi>Myriades opinionum,</hi> innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable opinions, and one ſo contrary to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they agrée like germaines lips. The monſtruoſſitie of whiche opinions are ſuch, that to remember them, it yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a marueylous terrour to the heart of many a good chriſtian. Theſe adulterate Ieſuites thinke it not ſufficient, to effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the mindes of the ſimple w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their falſe doctrine, and to defile the ſame with the venim of their viperous tongues, but alſo therewith haue ſo ſlaine the conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of many, that like me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſperat of their owne ſaluation, they make haſte to their
<pb facs="tcp:13584:94"/>owne deſtruction, who being puft by with preſumption, ſéeke to clime vp to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riote of the ſunne. But as <hi>Phaeton</hi> was ſerued, for going about to aſpire to his fathers ſecretes, and with a flaſhe of ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening was ſet all on fire: ſo theſe preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and ignorant people, ſhall be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued with the like, vnleſſe they repent, as a due rewarde of preſumption. This it is to followe the hiſſinges of the vipers broode, who neuer leaue their haunte, till they haue infected whole countreys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For this cauſe (welbeloued readers) this preſent treatiſe is publiſhed, to ſette before mens eyes, the abominable liues, and odious practiſes of theſe papiſtes, who in their owne conceiptes preſume, that they haue the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douted truth: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (if you marke <hi>intus &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi>) you ſhall wel vnderſtand to be quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>How they liued then, and long time ſithens, I finde in hiſtories. A Curate of Clauenie in the Duchie of Guyen, as <hi>Stephanus</hi> reporteth in his Apologie vppon Herodot. fol. <hi>72.</hi> did ſéeke to Saibborne the daughter of an honeſte man of the ſame towne to hys leude luſt and pleaſure, whome he haun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted in all places where ſhe wente: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinge, ſhe ſtill flatlye and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantlye denyed hym, whiche bredde the greater fire to hys beaſtlye deſire. And therefore on a daye, as the mayde was goinge to her fathers farme (ſomewhat out of the towne) this minion maſked in blewe ſarcenet, ſet all ouer wyth little ſtartes of gold, hauing a fine laune ouer
<pb facs="tcp:13584:95"/>his face, and his armes and legges bare, but couered likewiſe with laune. In this attire he appeared vnto her on the way, and with counterfait voyce, ſhewed her that he was the Virgin Marie, declaring vnto her that ſondrye afflictions ſhoulde fall vpon the towne, for the Luterane hereſie that was entered amongſt them, (againſte the whiche this Prieſte was a great Preacher) with ſondry other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, touchinge the ſame: and further willed her to ſhew it to the towne, that they mighte celebrate her feaſt wyth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinge and prayer, tellinge her withall, how ſhe had refuſed the frendſhippe and loue of a holye perſon, who in the ſame place (not longe before) made ſute vnto her, but ſhe denied hym: and therefore, if hée ſoughte any thinge at her handes hereafter, ſhe was admoniſhed that ſhée ſhoulde obey hym, for in ſo doinge there woulde greate happines fall vnto her by it: finallye ſhée was charged that ſhée ſhould not diſcouer this laſt parte to any Creatures: the ſimple wenche beléeued all for trueth, and deliuered it as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, and forewarneth them of that ſhoulde happen to Clanuenie, for the which cauſe (at the firſt) the inhabitants
<pb facs="tcp:13584:96"/>feared muche: and in the meane tyme thys poore ſoule yelded to hys villanie, whiche was ſhortly after ſpied, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe diſcouered, and hée executed as well woorthie. In a village néere vnto Coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnake, called Shermes; the Parſon there abuſed his owne ſiſter ſo long, that in the ende hée gate her with childe: which the Curate ſo couered, as ſhée (being holden verie holie throughe her déepe Ipocrifie) was taken to bée as chaſte a Virgin as might be: and therefore when this fault was ſpied, he was not a ſhamed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, that it procéeded of the holie Ghoſt, and that ſhée was a ſeconde Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The brute whereof comming to the hearinge of Charles, the Earle of Ango<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leme, he ſent of purpoſe to ſe how it was for that hée ſuſpected ſome abuſe in it. In whoſe preſence the ſuppoſed Virgin (of the age of thirtéene yeares) being ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged by her brother, vpon the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of her ſoule, to deliuer them the truth (repeating the ſecond time the ſame miracle) ſhe aunſweared, I take this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Sacrament to my damnation, before you all here preſent, that neuer any man did carnally know mée, or in that ſorte of ſinne touche mée, no more then that my
<pb facs="tcp:13584:96"/>brother haue done: they hearing ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a vowe retourned, and confirmed the ſhameleſſe report that was broached afore. But the Earle being wiſe, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the order of her othe néerer then they did, founde the fire by the ſmoke, and therefore ſente, and commaundinge that they ſhoulde bee ſeuerallye committed, and they both examined, wherebye the truth was confeſſed, and they both bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into aſhes, and dedicated vnto Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane. An example of a horrible inceſt, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with blaſphemie, whiche witneſſeth the continente and chaſte liues of thoſe that were vowed from Matrimonie: ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing the godly furie of the Cardinal of Lorane, who hearing that a Biſhop was ſecreatly married, ſaid, I maruaile how theſe Lutherans haue geuen themſelues ouer to all the deuils, to marrie, ſeeinge they haue libertie otherwiſe, after their liking to ſatiſfie their luſts, at their own pleaſure. This did hée ſpeake generallye to thoſe that liued then of their holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church. For, what was it that thoſe wretches woulde not attempte, to fullfill (after their inſatiate gluttonye) their beaſtly and rompwood lechery, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this Priuiledge, <hi>Si non caſte, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb facs="tcp:13584:97"/>caute.</hi> A Ieſuite Prieſt in Vienna in Auſtria, made it no conſcience to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe a marchantes wiſe (whome hée had vnder confeſſion) before all the Saintes of either kinde, not ſimply in the church, but behind the Aultar, and on good Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. This fellow beinge taken wyth the manner, although the faulte deſerued as vile death as mighte bée deuiſed) yet hée was onely enioyned to do pennance, and to forbeare ſayinge of Maſſe thrée mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes. Their Legate (comminge from Rome) thinking this too ſharpe a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente for ſo ſmall a faulte, preſently ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued him, whoſe ordinary Maſſes were afterward found of as good ſauour, taſte, and digeſtion, to thoſe that willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured them) as if they had béene ſayd of the moſt maidenlieſt Prieſt in the world. So that it one woulde ſearche the euilles of all ſortes, committed by theſe raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rabble that feede on the Church, hee ſhould finde them innumerable. But, as touching their puniſhmentes, it was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or for the moſt part ſo light, that it ſeemed (in déede) but a mockerie: where as, on the other ſide, if any were but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to couet the true way to their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, fire and ſworde was layde vpon
<pb facs="tcp:13584:97"/>them, wyth all the rigour and violence that might be. Many ſuch hiſtories could I recite, but becauſe they are written in diuers bookes at large, I purpoſe to make no more wordes thereof, but will referre the Readers to <hi>Stephanus, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,</hi> and other Hiſtoriographers, who haue written aboundauntlye thereof. Now I am deſirous to heare the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and errours of theſe late Prieſtes, whoſe life and conuerſation is altogether vnknowne to all this Engliſh lande.</p>

Nowe there remayneth that I ſhoulde diſplaye the wickedneſſe of the Maſſe Prieſtes, I will ſpeake no more, then that whiche myne eyes haue ſéene. At Gaunt in Flaunders, there was a prieſt that tolde mée <hi>Anno domnini. 1578.</hi> that if amonge the Turkes he could find better liuing, he would not be afrayd to offer ſacrifice to Mahomet. For (ſayd he) it is not the outwarde action that proue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the indignation &amp; diſpleaſure of the moſt higheſt, but it is the inwarde cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, being rebellious and diſobediente to Gods holy will and ordinaunces, that
<pb facs="tcp:13584:98"/>cauſeth the reprobation of man. I am not conſtrained (ſayd this wretched cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife) to obſerue the commaundementes of God in word and dede, but in thought onely. How voyde of reaſon, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and Chriſtianitie theſe his wordes were, all men maye ſée. Amongeſt the Turkes hée woulde liue as a Turke, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the Papiſtes, (the Turkes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen germanes,) he woulde liue as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſte, and amongeſt the Chriſtians hée woulde fayne hymſelfe a Chriſtian. At Auſburgh in high Almaine, there was a Prieſte at Maſſe, <hi>Anno domini 1578.</hi> that had hys Lemman to ſupplye the roome of the Clarke that was abſente, now ſir ſhee being vnfitte for that place, when ſhe ſhould haue ſaid <hi>Suſcipiat do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus hoc ſacrificium, &amp;c.</hi> ſhée ſayde, <hi>Et cum ſpiritu tuo.</hi> What hore (quoth hée) canſt thou not ſay, <hi>Suſcipiat domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus hoc ſacrificium &amp;c.</hi> Maſter Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (quoth ſhee) you are to blame to vſe ſuche termes by me, in preſence of thys people.

               <p>I thincke thys Prieſte was glad to ſaye Maſſe, to quenche hys thirſte and to pleaſe hys pallate. At a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage called Weſtendorfe in highe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, there was a Prieſt, by report of the Pariſhioners, that as he was ſaying Maſſe, there came newes vnto him by a little lad, that a certaine yong man was a bedde with his Lemman.

Could you not haue told me of this your paſtime, that I mought haue taken part with you? Now therfore I enioyne you this pennance, that you come in your ſhirte and ſmocke to heare the reſt of my Maſſe.

               <p>It is nothing ſtrange. In Italie there happened the like thing, for in the Neapolitane kingdome there were certaine (as farre as I do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) Prieſtes, that borrowed a greate ſomme of money of the deuill, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to repay the debt by ſuch a daye, if not, that he ſhould vſe them at hys plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. When the day came, theſe Romiſh Italian Prieſtes were merrily banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, not being mindfull of their promiſe touching the diſcharging of the debt: the deuill came amongeſt them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his mony: now, when it was tolde him that they had it not readie, hee ſtew them euerie one to the nomber, of fiue and twentie Prieſtes, and lay men. This thing was reported vnto me to be true at Sinegallie, whether it be true or falſe I cannot tell, but I ſuppoſe it to bée rather true then otherwiſe, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye auouched the ſame to bee true, and they were all Italians. At Auſburghe there was a Prieſte that had dronken more then ſufficient who when hee was
<pb facs="tcp:13584:100"/>at Maſſe, he cryed, ho la hoſtes, geue me ſome more béere for I am a thirſt. Thys Prieſt notwithſtandinge was aboute to make hys Sauiour, in tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the bread and wine by a few wordes vttered by him, into the very bodie and bloud of Chriſte. This Prieſte was not farre vnlike vnto him that was at Maſſe, who when he was at his <hi>memento,</hi> his boy came vnto hym, and tolde hym that his neighbours ſwine were entered into his garden: he had no ſooner hearde theſe wordes, but in a ſurie he brake forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſpeech, forgetting his <hi>memento,</hi> and not remembringe the place wherein he was, what in the deuils name do the ſwine there: goe thither (ſaide hée to hys boy) and kill them euery one.</p>

At Eraneble in France, there came a fellow to the Biſhop, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to take holye orders: the Biſhop willed hym to reade thys place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Faciemus hic tria tabernacula, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num tibi &amp;c.</hi> this word <hi>Tabernacula,</hi> he could not wel pronounce, but thus he read that place, <hi>Faciemus tria traber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But I will now ſpeake of one that came to the Biſhop of Graiſoble. <hi>Anno domini 1579.</hi> to ſeeke for Prieſthoode, and when he came to be examined of the Biſhops Chaplaine, touchinge doctrine, he put his hand in his pocket, and ſaid to his examiner, <hi>Ecce hic:</hi> and gaue hym a handfull of money. Then the Biſhops Chaplaine came to his Lordſhip, &amp; tolde him that hée had not a better Scholler to be examined in thre yeares before. Then the Biſhop ſente this man to a ſinginge Cannon of the Qutere, to bee prooued whether he could ſinge Maſſe or no, and when he came to be examined, he gaue alſo a handfull of money to this ſinginge Cannon: and as ſoone as he receiued the money, he tolde the people that he knew by a few interrogations propounded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſaid fellow, that it was in vaine to examine him farther in notes of ſinging. Thus by meanes of his money, he was counted both learned, and alſo a good Qutereman, whereas hee was neyther
<pb facs="tcp:13584:102"/>of both. This ſtorie I know to bee true for the ſame thinge hath beene reported vnto me by diuers, aſwell of the clergie, as of the laitie. Many ſuch ſtories coulde I recite, but few may content the mind of the Reader. And at Moleina, a little towne in the Dolphin of Fraunce, there was a Prieſt that kept his ſiſter, in ſtede of a concubine, as it appeared at laſt, in that ſhe was wyth childe, and confeſſed her brother to bee the father thereof. Whereupon it was enioyned hym by way of pennance, to goe and viſite <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donna di Loreto.</hi>

               <p>Thou haſt ſaid truth. But marke, I will tell thée of a ſtorie woorthie the hearings, wherein is to bee noted the diſsimulation of a ſhauelinge Prieſt. In citie called Langue in Picar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, there was a holye (as they termed him) Prieſt, that tooke his pilgrimage to S. Iames in Spaine: who when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned home, he boaſted of ſo many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations and viſions, that he would not
<pb facs="tcp:13584:103"/>otherwyſe haue the people perſwaded, but that S. Iames brought hym to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and there ſhewed hym all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious buildinges that are to bee ſéene. The walles (ſayd hee) of that Princely Pallace of God, were altogether of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall, Saphire, Diamonds, Carbuncles, and ſuche other precious ſtones. The pauementes, both within and without that heauenly and celeſtial court of God, were of gold, ſiluer, and ſuch other coſtly mettall. The couering therof was bright ſhininge golde, the like whereof I neuer ſawe before. Then S. Iames broughte mee to dinner, amongeſt the Apoſtles, where I refreſhed my ſelf very princely: at the laſte I ſhooke handes wyth all the Apoſtles, and ſo tooke my farewell of them. Then S. Iames gaue mee hys pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in ſiluer, and promiſed, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer woulde offer to the ſame, during the tyme that I am at Maſſe, he woulde cary his ſoule at his departure to heauen The people beleued euery word that he ſpake, and offered much mony to the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, which the Prieſt receiued, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it to hys owne vſe. This Prieſt made ſimple women beleue, that if the would not condiſcend to hys luxurious
<pb facs="tcp:13584:103"/>and fleſhlye requeſt, S. Iames woulde take reuengemente vpon them: ſo that by this his pilgrimage, he gate money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly, and allured many wemen, to Venus follye. Thys is the fruite of Prieſtes pilgrimages, I woulde to God they conſidered the end of this their coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terfaite holineſſe. There was another Prieſt that trauailed with me on Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in Fraunce to S. Sebaſtian, thys mans life-was diſſolute, his wordes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and his manners leude, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye Maſſemonger had committed ſome hainous offence, hee determined wyth the conſultation of his ghoſtly father, and other of hys annoynted companie, to make a vowe to viſite one or other holy place, for expiation of his ſinnes: and in his whole pilgrimage he meditated vpon nothinge els, then vpon liberall wemen of their bodies. Oh God, what doe theſe hipocrites meane, to vaunte of holines, and meddle ſo muche with the worlde: doe they not paſſe to diſſemble thus wyth men, as they do, for temporall gaine, and to be diſherited of life euerlaſting by this their folly? Let not the Papiſts imagine that I haue reported thys of malice, or that I vntruely told the liues of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciuious
<pb facs="tcp:13584:104"/>clergie: or pray for them, I wiſh their conuerſion in the Lord. Their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and vntrue reportes of mee haue troubled my patience neuer a whit: ſpeake what you will, raile and reuile, ſkoffe and taunte me at your pleaſure, counte mee what you will, a foole, an aſſe, vnlearned, and whatſoeuer beſides, I am not offended, I am not mooued with theſe your vncharitable termes: God conuerte your mind to vnderſtand his holy word, and vnfainedly to obſerue it, duringe life: and God make vs all fit inſtrumentes for hys bleſſed kingdome, and graunt that we may glorifie hym in our doinges, edifie his churche and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and profite our owne ſoules, and ſo enioy the crowne of glorye in the kingdome of the moſt higheſt. I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite thrée or foure more incontinente Prieſtes, and ſo make an ende of thys matter. Lingano in Italie, a Prieſt kept his owne daughter, in ſteede, of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, and being made great with child by this Prieſt ſhée confeſſed, (as ſone as ſhée was examined by the Magiſtrates) that her father, the Prieſt and parſon of the pariſhe had gotten her wyth childe. When thys Prieſt was broughte to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb facs="tcp:13584:104"/>examined, he denied not his manlie facte, but ſtoode in proouinge the ſame hys vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall déede, to haue bene lawfull and commendable: for (ſaide he) ſhee is my baſe daughter, I haue nouriſhed and broughte her vp from a childe vnto wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans eſtate, and in recompence of all my charges, coſtes, and labour, ſhe ought to ſupply my want with her own bodie, beinge forbidden to marrie: and with whome can ſuche a man as I am, being deſtitute of a wife, be better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, then wyth hys owne daughter baſe begotten? If I had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other mans daughter, I had offended none but the parentes: but ſéeinge I haue vſed myne owne daughter, to fullfill my luſte, no man (I thinke) oughte to bee offended. Thys bawdie Prieſte eſcaped vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, for they that had the examination of him, belike were as had as hee. How wittie his words were, let al men iudge. If a Maſſemonger cannot get one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to accompliſh his libidinous luſt, he will then procure to himſelfe his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yea ſiſter, yea and hys mother, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then faile: ſuch is the impretie of the idolatrous Prieſtes. At Viterbo in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, <hi>Anno domini 1579.</hi> there was a
<pb facs="tcp:13584:105"/>Prieſte borne at Naples, that loued the Burdell houſe ſo well, that he ſayd three or foure Maſſes in one day, to gette hym ſome money, to the ende his often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge to the Burdell houſes mighte be more accepted. As I my ſelfe trauayled from Millane to Rome, I haue had them oftentunes in my iourney, that woulds not ſticke to play the parte of a ingler in their maſkinge garmentes at the aultar, before whome they woulde, yea euen a ſhéepe if you gaue him but ſix pence. And you ſhall finde a popiſh prieſte, that will ſay Maſſe in the fieldes for the ſafegarde of the ſheepe againſte the wolfe. Let tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailers reprooue mee: if this bee vntrue, that a man for a little money, ſhall haue manye Maſſes, and that of one Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, in one day. At Vigleuan a citie in Italie <hi>Anno domini 1578.</hi> there was a riche citizen that had buried hys wife, and afterwardes coulde take no reſt in his houſe in the night time, for the ſturre and noyſe of hys wiues ſpirite. This citizen aſked councell of a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine of our Ladies, what was beſt to be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this prieſtes deuice was, for lucre and gains that there ſhoulde bee manye Maſſes ſoonge for his wiues ſoule, which
<pb facs="tcp:13584:105"/>was (as he ſaid) tormented by the deuel in his houſe. This citizen demaunded of the prieſt what money hee woulde take to redéeme hys wiues ſoule by hys Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, from all ſuch tormentes, miſery and griefe, wherewyth ſhee was perplexed and tormented. The prieſte vndertooke for a hundreth crounes that hys wiues ſoule ſhoulde flie to heauen. The citizen, to be in quiet, was contente to graunte his requeſt. The prieſte vſed a long ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſaye Maſſe for the deliuery of thys ſpirite, but it woulde not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e: the more Maſſes were ſaid, the more was the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite vexed, and made the greater rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinge in the citizens houſe. The citizen being in a chafe, came to the prieſte, and told him, that if he woulde not vſe better Maſſes, to deliuer his wiues ſpirite from that vexation and trouble wherein ſhee was, he would not onely haue his mony backe againe, which the prieſt had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but alſo take reuengemente vpon him, for that he by his flattery had béene deluded: when the prieſt heard thys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge ſomewhat ſkillfull in magicke, hee craued to come to hys houſe that nighte, and I cannot tell howe, whether by hys coniuration, or by any other meanes, it
<pb facs="tcp:13584:106"/>came to paſſe that the ſpirite neuer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared afterwardes nor yet was hearde. But ſurely if he had not bene ſkillfull in Nigromancie, he had neuer chaſed away this ſpirite of illuſion out of the citizens houſe by hys Maſſes. Hee tried ſeuen or eight weekes by theſe Maſſes to get this ſomme of money and coulde not for all that, but for one or other couenante and bargaine he made with the deuill in one night, the citizens wiues ſpirite neuer did afterwardes once diſquiet the houſe. Thus oftentimes it happeneth with the papiſtes, that when with their Maſſes they obtaine not their purpoſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, then by their magical arte they will do what they can. There was a Prieſte at Hadocke in Bauaria, that made a woman beleue, that ſhe ſhould be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to a mare, and that the deuill ſhould ride vpon her ouer craggie moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and ſtony places vnles ſhe would fullfill his fleſhly luſt. This Prieſte, for that he had fallen out wyth her husband, durſt not come to his houſe, nor his wife to the prieſtes houſe. The prieſte wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge no crafte and ſubteltie, when the woman came to confeſsion, hee willed her to repaire home, and to faine herſelfe

As ſoone as ſhée came home ſhe ſounded, as thoughe the ſpirite was readie to take her, <hi>viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum vale</hi> from the bodie. Why howe now frowe (quoth her huſbande) what ayleth you to be ſicke, and ſo ſicke, that you are like to die? Oh husbande ſende ſpéedelye for maſter Parſon, or els I muſte ſaye adue to you all, adue to thys worlde, before I haue confeſſed that to maſter parſon, which troubleth my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and from whome I haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in my confeſsion a thing which I could haue vttered to day. Ah my bodye is féeble, my harte panteth full ſore, my ſtrength fayleth me, my féete beginne to ware colde, my breath is ſhorte, I am readie to geue vp the ghoſt: Oh call for maſter parſon, that I may bée ſhriuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The prieſte was ſente for, and as hee entered the chamber, hee ſprinckled the ſame with water, and then he ſayd ſo his patient, how do you neighbour, I am come hether to geue you ghoſtly comfort, and to heare your confeſsion, and to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacramente of holye vnction.
<pb facs="tcp:13584:107"/>He cauſed all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to depart thence, vntill he had played hys feates of actiuitie wyth her: but the morning following ſhe being recouered, was very merrye and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans husband being a wiſe man ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſome ſecrete frendſhip to haue béene betwéene hys wife and the parſon, in ſo much that euer afterwardes hee inuited the parſon to dinner and ſupper, twice or thrice a wéeke. Vppon a tune he fayned that he would make a iourney to Inghel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatte, and remayned at home vnknown to his wife in a counting houſe of his, and then the good wife, not miſtruſtinge any thing, made the prieſt of the pariſh to bée called, and ordained notable good chéere for his entertainement: at night, as they were merrie &amp; had made good chéere, her husband tooke them both naked, &amp; made the prieſt lighter by both hys ſtones. Oh villaine (quoth the husband to the prieſt) haſt thou thus vſed me for the great cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie that I haue ſhewed thée? therfore I am reuenged on thée: holde, take thy ſtones, and kepe them in thy purſe at all times when thou ſayeſt Maſſe: nowe I am out of doubt thou wilte neuer make more kuckoldes. Then hée put his wife
<pb facs="tcp:13584:107"/>in a cloſe chamber, and gaue her breade and water once a daye, for the ſpace of one whole yeare. There was an other prieſt but here in England by reporte in Quene Maries time that heard the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of a gentlewoman, how ſhe vſed the carnall company of a younge gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of that pariſh: the prieſt beeing of a leacherous diſpoſition practiſed by all meanes poſſible to obtaine her fauoure, and by amorous talke he aſſayed her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes, but all in vaine: at laſt there came a maide a ſeruaunte of that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans to him to ſhrift, and when ſhe had made an ende of her confeſſion, hee aſked her where ſhe was borne, ſhe told him in ſuch a ſhiere, naming Yorkeſhire: hee asked in what place there, and ſhee told him, the place, he asked the names of her parentes, and ſhee tolde hym, I am glad (quoth he) that I haue founde a couſin here, I came from thence where you were borne, and your mother was my aunte. You knowe I am parſon of this pariſhe (quoth hee) and haue ſome ſubſtaunce, I haue no kinsfolke here in this pariſhe beſides you good couſin, and therfore come often and continualiye to my houſe, for I will make you executrix
<pb facs="tcp:13584:108"/>of all that enioye. The poore maide was glad to finde ſuch a couſin, but when ſhe came vnto his houſe, hee had boughte a paire of perfumed gloues to be deliuered by his couſin to her miſtreſſe, whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliuered, her miſtreſſe on a ſodaine was wrapte in loue with the prieſte, ſo that ſhée from that tyme forewardes fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the prieſt full o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ten, and tooke hym for her ſeconde paramour. Thus the Prieſt, by his knauiſh conceite, got hys pleaſure on the gentlewoman. Popiſhe prieſtes wante not their traines of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telties, to bring that to paſſe, which they deſire: as by manye hiſtories of their liues it plainely appeareth. If I ſhoulde put in writing the abuſes of thoſe prieſts whome I haue partlye knowne, and of whome I haue partlye heard, then thys booke ſhoulde grow to a greate volume: but the chriſtian reader maye by the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of the vngodly ſhauelinges here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited take heede of their hipocriſie, and counte them as falſe Prophetes, and wolfes in ſhepes clothing. Their works do teſtifie, that among them, there is no God, but the Pope: and they ſaye with the fleſhly Epicure, <hi>Geue me that is here preſente, and let God alone with that is to
<pb facs="tcp:13584:108"/>come.</hi> If they were true Chriſtians, and had regard to their ſoules health, would learne by the ſermons of faythfull prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and vnderſtande by the holye ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, that beſides this life, beſides this world, this kingdome, theſe thinges here preſent, there be other things, and much greater thinges, an other life, an other kingdome, an other worlde to be looked for, doubtleſſe they would neuer diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the people as they do. What do they thinke that God knoweth not their ſecrete ſodomie, their pollution, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall copulation? Will they be named holy virgins, ſacred prieſtes, and chaſte ſacrificers, becauſe many of them, follow the councell of S. Benet. <hi>Si non caſte, tamen caute. <hi>If thou canſt not liue chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, walke cloſelie.</hi>
                  </hi> They paſſe not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe God in his heauenly ſight, but the diſpleaſure of man they dread: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they thinke themſelues as happie as any Saintes, if the people knowe not of their wickednes. Here in this world, they hunte for praiſe, vaineglorie, opinion of holines, and for humble reuerence: they will be eſtéemed before al others, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted as holy fathers, and chaplaines to our Ladie. O Engliſhe men beware of
<pb facs="tcp:13584:109"/>theſe falſe Prophetes, and you that are infected with the poyſon of Popiſh ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, aske councell in tyme, vſe ſome good remedie to purge the infection out of your ſoule, apply the ſalue of the woorde of God vnto your griefe, and you ſhalbe holpen, and made whole, ſafe, and ſound againe: repente, repente, flie from papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie while it is time, ere it be to late, for our life is very ſhorte. To write farther of the incontinencye of the Popes holye prieſtes, I thincke it not néedefull, for that the whole world knoweth, that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh prieſtes, for the moſte parte (yea in a manner all) haue euer liued and doe liue incontinentlye, for all their bragges of chaſtitie: they let looſe the raines to all the iuſt of the fleſh. Let trauailers to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine countreies beare witnes with me, of that whiche I haue reported by them. Marke the liues of the popiſhe prieſtes that are in Flaunders, Brabante, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Friſeland, Fraunce, Sauoy, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and Germanie: you ſhall confeſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they are wifeleſſe, yet that they are not womanleſſe; albeit they are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to marrie, yet that they are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to kepe concubines: they haue them, I haue ſeene them, I haue talked wyth
<pb facs="tcp:13584:109"/>them, and both he and ſhee haue confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that they were diſpenſed with all. It is not one prieſt that is diſpenſed to take a concubine: neither is it two, neither is it twentie, neither is it a thouſande: but al Maſſemongers, of what countrey ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, are ſuffered to haue concubines. Is it marueile then, that the Popes ſhaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges do ſo vehemently inueigh againſt prieſtes marriage, ſeinge it is tollerable for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to kepe concubines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the Popes diſpenſation were good and godlye (as it is not) ſurely better it were to take a con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cubine, then to marrie a wife. For a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine if ſhe were a ſhroe, and ſharpe of her tongue, a man might put her awaye, and take an other, and ſo hée coulde take the choyce and proofe of two and fiftie in one yeare, and the Pope ſhould diſpence withall. Is it to bee wondered that the Pope hath ſo many ſubiectes, more loyal vnto him, then to their naturall Princes, ſéeing he diſpenſeth with them in all their wickednes, and alloweth their deueliſh practiſes, and furthereth their impious and Venereous inclination, wyth hys Antichriſtian permiſsion? The whore of Babilon, the miniſter of Antichriſte, and the falſe Prophetes prohibite ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,
<pb facs="tcp:13584:110"/>but allow all maner of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. They condemyne chaſte wedlock and approue a laſciuious life. Theſe are the enormities of the churche of Rome, thys is the imquitie of the Pope and of his Cardinals, to eſtabliſh impietie, and to ſuppreſſe vertue, to puniſhe yea and count the heretiques Prieſtes, that ſeke vnder the yoke of wedlocke to avoyde fornication, and to leaue others vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that kéepe concubines: yea to permitte them to take as manye as they liſte. The law of chaſtitie enioyned vnto Prieſthoode, the which was firſte ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the preiudice of wemen, induceth Sodomie into the Churche: the delicate féeding and fare of the Clergie, will haue ryther a naturall purgation, or ſome worſe: the ſecrete trial and proofe of ſuch men is, that they do delighte in wemen. But God of his mighte for priny ſinnes doth ſende open vengeance. And though the worlde ſpieth their proneneſſe to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherye, yet neuer reckou they wedlocke any godly eſtate of liuing, though it were an onelye order inſtituted of God in the beginninge: yea for hys Prieſtes alſo But commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly they haue diſwaded both men and wemen from it, as from a moſt
<pb facs="tcp:13584:110"/>pernicious euill, or from a miſchiefe of al miſchiefes, callinge it fooliſhnes, beaſtli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a walking in darkeneſie, a maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of leachery, a fullfilling of fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye deſires, a grounde of all vice, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce of death, a corruptinge of may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denhoode, a lake of miſerie, a claye pit of vncleanneſſe, a thraldome of Egipte, a nette of Sathan, a ſnare of the deuell, and a ponde of perdition: ſuche peruerſe ſtomackes haue they borne to holy wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loeke, inſtituted by God himſelfe in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, and confirmed by Chriſtes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in Galile, and by the firſte miracle that he wrought there, as ſome write, at the marriage of S. Iohn the Euangeliſt, that they ſéeke to ſubuerte the ſame. Let the Pope diſanull prieſtes marriage, yet ſome will followe the councell of Paule in thys, that it is better to marrie then burne, better it is to take a wife, then to ſhutte a whore in his ſtudie, as Bonner did, the whiche place was ſhewed vnto me. Pope Calixtus the ſeconde of that name, was he that firſt forbad Prieſtes, Deacons or Subdeaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to haue wiues: whereupon one in Englande wrote a ſharpe Epigramme againſte him, thus much in effect:</p>

               <q>
                  <l>O bone Calixte, nunc omnis clerus odit te,</l>

                  <l>O good Calixtus nowe the Clergie doth thee hate,</l>
                  <l>In former time the Churchmen mighte enioy their ſpouſall mate:</l>

                  <l>Therefore as thou deſerued haſt, they do deteſt thy name.</l>
               </q>
               <p>This was the arrogante and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe impudencie of thys miniſter of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, Pope Calixtus, to forbid the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Prieſtes. And who ſéeth not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly theſe mens impudencye, whiche contemne and diſprayſe that honorable eſtate of holy wedlocke, to the ende that they mighte aduaunce their owne filthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and bring vncleane ſingle life, and the abominable vowes of their counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait chaſtitie in eſtimation, to the vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyinge of that in themſelues whiche hath bene long agoe foretolde by the holye A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.
<pb facs="tcp:13584:111"/>I will tell you of the knauerye of one or two prieſtes, in hearing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of two maides at Naples, as I was credibly informed of certaine mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes that had beene there when thys thinge was done: and trauayled in my companie, <hi>Anno domini 1578.</hi> This Neapolitane Prieſt was incenſed wyth the loue of a fayre mayde of Naples, hee attempted manye wayes by large effers, &amp; greater promiſes to winne this maide to ſatisfie his inordinate luſt: but hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in vaine. At laſt, he deuiſed to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure her to follie after this manner, when the maide came to be ſhriuen of him, and had ended her confeſsion, the Prieſt ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that our bleſſed Ladye appeared bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in his ſtudie, and willed hym to tell the mayde, that in ſtede of abſolution ſhee ſhoulde ſléepe with him that nighte. For of her (ſayd our Lady to the Prieſt) ſhould a child be begotten that ſhould be one of the pillers of the Churche. When the mayde heard thys, ſhe aunſweared, oh good God, what cauſed our bleſſed Ladie to bid me ſleepe with you, but ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our bleſſed Ladie hath willed mee to lie by your ſide to night, I will do as ſhe hath commaunded, for feare of her heauy
<pb facs="tcp:13584:112"/>diſpleaſure. There was a Prieſte at Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagaglia <hi>Anno domini 1580.</hi> who wanted money, it may be to offer to the Curtezans, and therefore hee inuented this ſhift. There was a rich widow that had good ſtore of mony, and came to him to be ſhriuen: now when ſhée had ended her confeſsion, hee tolde her that it was reuealed vnto hym in a viſion, that if this woman would not goue hym toure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore crownes, he ſhould not abſolue her of her ſinnes, vntill ſhee woulde vowe a monaſticall lyfe. Thys woman had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depart from ſourſcore crounes, then not to haue bene abſolued. I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of theſe Ieſurtes, for that they are ſent by their Rectors to thys land, to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre the ſame with hereſies, and haue ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen euidente notice to our countreymen of their hypocriſie and diſsimulation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortinge them to beware that by their outward ſhew of holines they do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them.

But now we are aſhamed of this fooliſhe preachinge, by the whiche it hath pleaſed God to ſaue al thoſe which beléeue in him and béeinge puffed vp wyth out owne fleſhly minde, we do rather chooſe proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to deale in thoſe thinges wherein we are ſlenderly ſéene, preaching fables and lies, and not the law of God, whiche is vndefiled, and conuerting mens ſoules.

               <p>Kings of Englande firſt founded this hoſpitall, and bought certaine houſes within the walles of the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> for the maintenance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: as for landes, it hath none belonging vnto it. Cardinall <hi>Morone</hi> is protectour thereof, and of the Engliſh colledge adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto the ſame. D.

<pb facs="tcp:13584:120"/>and ſtately, that hée rideth in a Wagon, as though hee were a prince, and cauſeth the Engliſh ſchollers to follow him all a long, aloofe, a farre of.</p>
               <p>While he thus rangeth and wandereth abrode, the Engliſhe ſchollers are ſure to fare hard: but the Welſhmen will not be ſo vſed. Maiſter <hi>Morice</hi> (ſay they) is our countruman, and therefore we will fare of the beſt: and ſurely ſo they did, as I vnderſtoode by their owne confeſſion. For they had the beſt chambers, the beſt apparrell and the beſt commons: for the cooke was a welſhman, the kéeper of the wine ſeller was a welſhman, &amp; al were welſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that had any office: ſo that they could controul the other ſchollers at their pleaſure. And when any engliſh ſcholer made ſute to be of the Colledge, he would aſke him with a grim countenance from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he came, and what was the cauſe of his comming: then he woulde tell him that there came more wandering fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues out of england then out of Wales. But if he vnderſtoode there came a welſh man, he woulde receiue him very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly and entertaine him ioyfully, and
<pb facs="tcp:13584:121"/>ſo woulde his countreimen take him by the fiſte, with many congratulations.

This <hi>Morice</hi> the welſhman neuer loued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were borne in England, for proofe whereof I will bring his owne ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reportes, which I haue heard with mine eares vttered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his owne mouth, euen to his countreimen. The engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (ſayd he) are proud and ambitious braggers, and they are ſlaunderers of our nation. If he had ſayd, both we welſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and you engliſhmen are high minded, ful of enuie, bragging and ſtandering one of another, I would haue holden with him: but ſeeing he ſought to cleare himſelfe, and his owne countreymen, in ſhifting their faults from themſelues to the eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen, I commend not his charitie. He would ſay often, that the engliſh papiſts were plaine hypocrites, and had no more religion (to vſe his owne termes) then a
<pb facs="tcp:13584:121"/>dogge: that they ſought for vaineglorie, and a name of holines. And ſo they did doubtles, and ſo did his owne countrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men too, albeit he ſpake nothing againſt them, as hereafter in the ſequel of this chapter moſt manifeſtly ſhall appeare, to the viewe of England. I will ſpeake the truth for both, I will not ſpare to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the malice and hypocriſie of the one and the other, I will not be partiall, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall affection drawe mée to diſplay the offences of the one, and kéepe in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the enormities of the other: but with an vpright conſcience and an equal minde I will write of them both, as well of welſhmen as of Engliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth ſhall giue place. They neuer came to dinner or ſupper without iarring &amp; brau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, they vſed ſuch ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious names the one to the other, as I am loth to rehearſe for Ciuilitie ſake. I am a Gentleman quoth the one: thou art a raſcall, quoth the other. The welſhman beginneth to fret and fume, and ſaith, albeit I came to Rome with broken &amp; rent apparrell, yet I am borne of as good blood as thou art: ſtop there
<pb facs="tcp:13584:122"/>quoth the other: nay, I tell thée plainely I am as good a Gentleman as thou art: where ſir, quoth the Engliſhman, in Wales I trowe. For if a man of your countrie, bée able to ſpend fortie groates a yéere, and pay thirtie to the Quéene, hée is a Gentleman of Wales. Then chafed the other, and ſaid, there are as good gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in Wales, as in any place of England. Before you came out of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onie,</hi> and conquered this auncient Iſland of <hi>Britan,</hi> now named Englande by the traines of your ſubtiltie, wée Welſhmen ruled the coaſtes of England: but nowe being vanquiſhed through your pollicie, wée are driuen to Wales. Oh diueliſh mindes to conceiue ſuch wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly thoughtes: the Engliſhmen not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to abide ſuch malicious reproches, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them vacabounds, variets, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly raſcals, horſeſtealers, ſtealers of kye and oren. The Engliſhmen would abuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with quips, ſcofs, and mowes, that my mind is troubled ſore to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and put in writing the vncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and mutual diſſention of both coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triemen, Engliſh and Welſhmen. At
<pb facs="tcp:13584:122"/>laſt D. Morice brought all the Engliſh ſtudents before Cardinall <hi>Morone,</hi> and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very vncharitably, and ſaid they would bée ruled by noe aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements or exhortations which he vſed as hée ſaid, to haue them reconciled to the Welſhmen, and to bée contented to liue orderly and peaceably the one with the other. Hée mooued the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of their diſſolute liuing, and vnor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly behauiour in the Citie of Rome. Whoſe complaints were of ſuche force with the Cardinal, that they were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to depart the Colledge, and to get them packing out of the Citie. This charge being giuen to D. Morice, that they ſhoulde no longer remaine in the Colledge, Morice warned the Engliſh-ſtudents to depart, and kept his owne Countrie birdes with him, to ſolace and comfort him ſelfe with their company. Then the Engliſhmen tooke their ſcrips and bottels, &amp; went to an Engliſhmans houſe that was married, to dinner: and after dinner, as far as I remember, they had acceſſe vnto the Pope, and the Pope hauing hearde before (I knowe not by
<pb facs="tcp:13584:123"/>whom) how vnruly they were, aſked the Engliſh ſtudents, aſſoone as he ſaw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how chaunce they went not out of the Citie. For (ſaid he) the gates of Rome are open, &amp; you may depart out of the Citie when you will, no man ſhall let you. Then ſaide the Engliſh ſtudents, if your holineſſe commaunde vs to forſake the Citie, wée will and muſt obey your holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe commaundement: but this we tell your holineſſe, that wée are come hither to Rome for conſcience: ſake, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. Hitherto your holineſſe hath ſuſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our néede, but if now (wée know not for what offence) wée bée baniſhed the holy Citie of Rome, wée ſhalbe the moſt vnfortunate men liuing. For to our own Countrie wée dare not returne, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated and ſeuered from their religion, and whither wée may goe (moſt holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) wée knowe not, wée haue neither lands, nor money to maintaine our wret<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched ſtate: oh holy father haue compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon vs, and forſake vs not vtterly, ſéeing we are redy to ſuffer martyrdome for your holineſſe ſake, and that by our death your authoritie ſhall be enlarged,
<pb facs="tcp:13584:123"/>your power increaſed, and your kingdom inriched. Wée are yours (holy father) both bodies and ſoules, by our life to doe your holineſſe obedient ſeruice, and by our death to doe you holyneſſe honour. Therefore (holy father) receiue vs againe (wée beſéech your holines) to fauour and grace, and wée ſhall from hencefoorth giue your holineſſe no occaſion of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or diſpleaſure againſt vs. The Pope hauing vnderſtood before, the cauſe of their diſſention with the welſhmen aſked why they woulde not be ruled by their Rector D. Morice, they anſwered, becauſe D. Morice fauoured his owne Countreymen more then them, beeing engliſhmen borne. The Pope being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by D. Lewis his Suffragane, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> if he ſhould not maintaine the engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they would the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> returne to england, and reuolt from papiſtrie, and denie him to be Peters ſucceſſour and Chriſts vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kar here on earth, and fearing the recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and backſlyding of his ſchollers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from him aſſented to their requeſt, and their petition was to haue the Ieſuites to be their ſuperiours, ſo that as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
<pb facs="tcp:13584:124"/>it came to paſſe. Then the Pope cauſed one of his chamberlaines to place them in the colledge agayne. D. Morice was remooued from thence to be proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the engliſh hoſpitall, and father <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus</hi> an Italian Ieſuite in D. Morice time of his rectorſhip, confeſſour, was choſen to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Rectour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> engliſh ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie. Father <hi>Ferdinando</hi> a Neapolitane was choſen to be maiſter of the ſtudents and ſo now eyght Ieſuites haue the rule of the engliſh ſeminarie. And ſince the Ieſuites came to beare office in that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary, at the requeſt of the engliſhe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes there were two welſhmen put out of the colledge, who as yet remaine in the Citie, and liue as the Popes penti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, much better then they did in the Colledge, becauſe there was ſuch enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſerpentine hatred betweene one countrie man and another. And becauſe I perceiued that the holy fathers the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites vſed partialitie, and blinde affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the one countrie more then to the other, full often I attempted to eſcape out of the citie ſecretly, and coulde not, for that feare kept me backe. I went to
<pb facs="tcp:13584:124"/>the Rector very often to aſke him leaue to departe to <hi>Rheines,</hi> there to be made prieſt, and to ſtudie out my courſe in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie. But where as it is written, I was put out of the Colledge, as <hi>non proficiens,</hi> howe can that bee? For they coulde not put me out of the Colledge, if I had beene ſuch a one as he malitiouſly fayneth me to be: becauſe I was halfe a yeere in probation. And if I had beene <hi>non proficiens,</hi> the lawes of the colledge, were ſuch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> then the Rector ſhould haue warned me to forſake the colledge. But it came not ſo to paſſe, for I ſtayd there afterwardes, ſomewhat more then a tweluemonth I am ſure, &amp; I was in that Colledge in probation, well néere the ſpace of two yéeres: and with muche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe I got leaue of the Rector, and the Pope, to goe to <hi>Rheines,</hi> as it is ſaide in my booke of recantation, &amp;c. Nowe, to procéede farther in the narration of the diſſention of the ſtudents of the Engliſhe Seminarie, there is ſuche backbiting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) ſuch ſlaundering, ſuch moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, ſuch rayling and reuiling the one of the other, that their colledge may wel
<pb facs="tcp:13584:125"/>hée named a Seminarie of diſſention, a Seminary of hypocriſie, a Seminarie of pride, a Seminarie of treacherie, and a Seminarie of all miſchiefe. They haue conceaued ſuche an inwarde grudge one towards an other, they are ſo ſtiffe nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſo waywarde, and ſo crabbed, that ſeldome or neuer they will be reclaimed. Aſſone as they haue receiued the idol of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maſſe, and are gone out of the Churche, they fall out for ſome odde trifle or other, and vſe ſuche reprochfull wordes one to another, that it is rather a Hell then a houſe, a place of diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then a ſeminary of godlines. When they come to confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they knéele downe before a picture, and there looke as though they came to Tyborne: they bend their eyes towards the grounde, their faultes are ſo many, that they are aſhamed to looke vp to the heauens, and there they tell the Prieſte one veniall ſinne or other, for mortall ſinne they neuer commit (as they ſay, and as the Ieſuites report of them. Such like faultes as theſe they tel their confeſſour, that they neglected to come to dinner at the firſt toule of the Bell, or els left their
<pb facs="tcp:13584:125"/>beades behinde, or came too late to aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate his fellowes to the ſchole, or roſe tardie to meditation. Theſe faultes are counted veniall, but as for mortall ſinnes, they neuer commit any, for then they ſhoulde looſe the name of holineſſe, and the Ieſuites ſhoulde bée muche diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, to ſuffer them to offend mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally. The ſtudents muſt bée counted as holy as the Ieſuites, for that theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fathers are appointed by our moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father the Pope, to traine vp the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in all vertue and godlineſſe. The Ieſuites cannot abide to heare that they haue ſinned mortally, euer ſince they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came members of that ſocietie of Ieſu. Amongſt the ſtudents of the Engliſh Se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minarie, &amp; the Ieſuites their ouerſéers, it is a veniall ſinne to goe to the <hi>Burdello,</hi> I meane the Stewes ſecretly, they make it no mortall ſinne. I coulde name ſome of the ſchollers, that in reſorting to thoſe places got the French pockes, but their names, vnleſſe I bée called to queſtion, I will bury in the pit of ſilence. When the ſchollers come to receiue the idoll of the Maſſe, they looke down ſo ſad as may
<pb facs="tcp:13584:126"/>bée, ſome wéepe, and ſome receiue it ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and knocking of their breaſts, with ſuch ſighing and ſorowfull lookes, as though they ſhould ſwallow vp a Toade or a Frogge. And when the Prieſt is at the eleuation, they beginne to knocke their breaſts apace, &amp; to kiſſe the ground, crying <hi>ſigniore mio,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi> may vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtand their holineſſe. When the Prieſt departeth from the aultar, they touch his maſking garments, and then put their handes to their mouthes. They think there procéedeth ſome vertue from the Prieſtes Cope, and when they put their hand to their mouth, that the holy Ghoſt entereth into their bodies. There they knéele after Maſſe is ſaide, ratling their beades, as though they meant to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake our bleſſed Ladie (beeing faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſléepe) with the noyſe thereof. They are as buſie in counting their beades, as any vſurer in ſumming his money, ſo they goe from image to image, with kiſſing, bowing, &amp; knéeling before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But when they come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church, all that ſhewe of holines is quite forgetten, the one be ginneth to praiſe himſelfe for his vertue, &amp; is not aſhamed to ſay that aſſone as he
<pb facs="tcp:13584:126"/>receiued the body (as he termeth it) of the Lorde, hée felt the holy Ghoſt ſuggeſting &amp; prompting him to ſay ouer his beades. The other beginneth likewiſe to extoll himſelfe: I haue ſaide (ſaith hée) ſo many Pater noſters, and ſo many Créedes, ſo many Aue Maries, &amp; ſo many Pſalmes of our Ladie, only by the ſuggeſtion of the holy Ghoſt. By and by after, they will holde a Parliament how all things ſhall bée ordered in Englande, then they will beginne to name who are fauourers of their ſide, and what iolly champions they bée: Oh (ſay they) if theſe were dead, it woulde bée a happy worlde, with vs: or if theſe were receiued to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of our holy mother the Church, then we ſhould be bleſſed, and haue our harts deſire. Theſe are the men of whome they talke ſo often, my L. of B. my L. of L. my L. T. my L. of H. Sir F. W. S. F. K. S. I. of C. Sir W. M. with diuers others, to whom God graunt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ioyfull yéeres, with health both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule: I hope they ſhall neuer ſée that golden day, that day of <hi>Iubiley.</hi>

               <p>God proſper the raigne of our ſoueraigne
<pb facs="tcp:13584:127"/>Ladie Quéene Elizabeth, and make her an olde woman in Iſrael: God defende her from all diſſembling Papiſtes. Now to come againe to our Engliſh ſtudents, the Popes ſchollers, they are readie to fall downe to painted walles, and faire Sepulchres full of rotten bones: they are Saintes in the ſight of men, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels inwardly. They hunt for vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and lightly regarde the portion of the godly in the kingdome of God. They are deuout in viſiting holy places (as they tearme them) and in going to Stations: they thinke that all their ſinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, if they mumble vp a fewe prayers in a couert tongue, before a dumbe idoll, and a painted image clothed like a liuing creature. What vice ſoeuer they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, if it bée not againſt the Pope, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his procéedinges, <hi>indulgentiam ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nariam obtinebunt omnium ſuorum pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum.</hi> They ſhall be releaſed of all their ſinnes, bée they neuer ſo monſtrous and execrable: yea, &amp; they ſhall deliuer their parents out of Purgatorie. I thinke a mouſe will carry their ſoules to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vpon his backe, or els Robin Redbreaſt,
<pb facs="tcp:13584:127"/>for greater expeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, will flie with their ſoules vnder his wings to heauen. They ſay it is vnpoſſible for them to bée out of fauour with God, if the Pope loue them, and graunt them indulgence. Oh Rome, Rome, What a holy Citie art thou, in thée all men ſhall bée ſaued that are rich, and will pleaſe thy ruler with franke giftes, and humble obedience doone vnto his holy reuerence: his ſchollers are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to bée in his grace, and to dwell in his holy and more then holy Citie, the Pope will graunt his ſchollers a frée pardon of all their ſinnes, liue they neuer ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, the Pope is their friende, and will giue them heauen, which place Lucifer holdeth in poſſeſſion. But when the Pope his truſtie ſeruant ſendeth any of his welwillers thither, it is ſo large a rowme, that hée prepareth ſuche cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers for them, as are méete for their degrées: but if hée wyll preſume to ſend any of his acquaintance, or of his fauourers, or of his diſciples to the other heauen, where Chriſte raigneth perpetually: Saint Peter the porter of heauen gates wil not ſuffer them to enter in, but will charge
<pb facs="tcp:13584:128"/>them to depart, for that the Pope vſur peth the ſeate of an Apoſtle, and ſaith, he is Saint Peters Succeſſour, whereas he followeth not Saint Peter in life, nor in doctrine.</p>

Firſt, they muſt riſe early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, aſſone as they haue heard the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde ſounde of the Bell. For the firſt ſounde is for the Ieſuites, to riſe and fall downe on their maribones, and fall to contemplation. The ſecond ſound of the Bell is for the Ieſuites, to ceaſſe from meditation &amp;, for the ſchollers to ryſe vp to rowle their beades, after the maner of a péece of cloth: then to knéele downe to contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for one houre ſpace, and when the Bell hath roung againe, to riſe vp from contemplation, and to heare Maſſe, and Maſſe being ended to repaire to their chambers, and there to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide vntill the Bel warneth them to the
<pb facs="tcp:13584:128"/>ſcholes. Firſt the deuines <hi>ſcolaſticall</hi> and poſitiue, then the phyloſophers and logicians, and afterwardes the rhetorici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and gramarians. One forme after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, at diuers and ſeuerall ringing of the bell, goeth to heare the publique lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the ſchooles of Rome: and when they are come home from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſchooles, then one or other ringeth the bell to waſhing of handes, ouer one of the Towels, which are there to wipe their handes therewith there is written, <hi>pro ſacerdotibus,</hi> no ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler dareth to wipe his handes therewith. Then one ringeth the bell to dinner, and one of the prieſtes is appointed by father miniſter a Ieſuite, to ſay grace, and grace is ſaid in latine, and during dinner time, one of the ſchollers, who is appointed for that weake, aſcendeth and goeth vp to the pulpit, whiche ſtandeth in the lower ende of the refectorie or haule, and there-hée readeth one hyſtorie or other, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the <hi>Martyrologue.</hi> But if any of the ſchollers haue committed ſome veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſinne, as they terme it, then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth his fault, and inioyneth ſuche penance as is ſpecified by the ſuperiours
<pb facs="tcp:13584:129"/>or written in his ſcedule, or peece of paper &amp; aſſoone as he hath done reading, hee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth down, &amp; immediately after wards, one or other ringeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bel, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they riſe vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dinner to recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; their talke is of England, wiſhing &amp; hoping y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof, they had rather that aliants and ſtraungers did rule the lande. And that I lye not, hée that is reconciled to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Goſpel, and to the concorde of the reformed Church, may beare teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie (for this man was in my time in the Engliſhe Seminarie, and viſited a ſcholler, once lying ſicke in his bedde) which ſcholler died within a while after. There were fiue or ſixe ſchollers, with the <hi>Neapolitane</hi> Prieſt, and a Ieſuite then beyng of the Engliſhe Seminarie, nowe reader of Philoſophie in the common ſchooles: theſe perfect ſcholers talked of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spaniſh Nauie, of D. Nicholas <hi>Saunders</hi> then Captaine generall ouer the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which came out of Spaine with him, they hoped (ſaid they) to ſée the Maſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly aduanced in Englande, for (ſaye they) wée had rather haue the Quéene of Scottes, or the King of Spaine to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
<pb facs="tcp:13584:129"/>the land, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our gracious Quéene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom God defende, for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye ſake, and the maintenance of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. When I hearde theſe vnnaturall woordes pronounced of vnnaturall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes towards their natural ſoueraigne, and Countrie: I could no longer forbeare to ſpeake ſomewhat after this manner, againſt theſe moſt malicious and blooddy wiſhings. Though (ſaid I) being then moreinclined to ſuperſtition, then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the religion of our Quéene &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey differeth from the Catholique faith, yet doe I not reade in Gods woorde, that it is lawfull for vs to wiſhe the death of our naturall Princeſſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ouerthrowe of our louing Countrey, wherein we were borne. Wée ought ſay they (as wée may reade in the ſcripture) hartily to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for the happie conuerſion of our Quéene and countrey to the faith of the Romanes. Oh (ſay they) we had rather haue our parentes and friendes burned to aſhes, then that they ſhoulde renounce the profeſſion of the faith of Rome: but God ſendeth a ſhrewd cow ſhort hornes. Neuertheleſſe, our hope and confidence is
<pb facs="tcp:13584:130"/>in the Lord of hoaſtes, that y<hi rend="sup">c</hi> wiſhed day of theirs ſhall neuer come to paſſe: if the euent of all things ſhould happen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their wiſhed mind, they would not ſpare to imbrue their giltie handes in the innocent blood of their parentes and kinſfolke, that ſhoulde boldely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly confeſſe Chriſt to bée the inuiſible head of the Churche, and not the Pope. Father <hi>Ferdinando</hi> commended their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous and Diueliſh wiſhes. For breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſake, I omitte to delate vpon their tir a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nous doyngs, deſires, and demaunds. Nowe I procéede to certifie the curteous Reader of their manner of penaunce. If any had committed ſome faulte by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or through diſobedience, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywiſe, he hath penance inioyned him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the qualitie of the crime. As if he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to late to aco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany his fellow to y<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſchooles, then he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to ſtand at dinner or ſupper, vntill the Rectour biddeth him ſit downe. If any other roſe ſomewhat too late to contemplation, hée is charged to lye proſtrate on the ground vpon ſome couerlet or blanket, and there hée lyeth on his backe, vntill father Ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, or father Miniſter, in the Rectours
<pb facs="tcp:13584:130"/>abſence willeth him to riſe vp. Some for not comming to church, ſome for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the hearing of exhortations, ſome for paſſing by any Ieſuites, ſome for one fault, and ſome for another receue diuerſe penances. Some holde their fingers in their mouthes in the middle of the haule, ſome are forbidden to drinke, ſome haue not their antepaſt their firſt diſh of meat, or of fruites, or of rootes: ſome of ther poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt their after diſh, eyther of fruites or chéeſe. And thus much in breuity fouching their maner of penances. Euery one hath his bedde alone, for feare of the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acte of Sodomie, which is vſuall at Rome amongſt all fortes of people. And a little before midnight, one of the Ieſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes commeth to the ſcollers Chambers, to ſée what rule they kéepe, and whether euery one bée in his owne bedde. The ſcollers, both in winter and ſummer, weare two gownes, the one vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a doublet, and brieches in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: but in winter, they haue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer apparell. Euery wéeke they are bounde to ſay ouer their beades, for the Popes health, and his floriſhing proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: and for the whole colledge of the
<pb facs="tcp:13584:131"/>the princely &amp; Maieſticall Cardinalls. The firſt time that I came to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe Seminarie, father Rectour aſked if I had any holy beades, I tolde him no: the next day the Rectour gaue me a payre of beades, and warned me diligently and affectionately to pray inceſſantly for our patrone y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes holineſſe, as he termed it. I will (ſayde I) ſay ouer my beades as well as I may: but I could not tell what to doe with my ſwapping beades, vnleſſe to fray away dogges. For I coulde better number the beades ſeuerally, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay my prayers on them. I neuer learned to vſe my beades, but contented my ſelfe with my little primer booke, and when I loſt them, I neuer ſought any other.</p>
               <p>I was complayned of to the Rectour, for that I regarded no better the Diuels guttes. To procéede further, to write of the orders of the engliſh ſeminarie, I thinke it not amiſſe once a moneth, euery ſtudent hath giuen him the name of ſome Saint, whom for that moneth he taketh to be his patrone and defendour to him, hee directeth his prayers, and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, as to God him ſelfe. In that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb facs="tcp:13584:131"/>fragment of paper is written, to what purpoſe he ſhall pray, as for the Popes health and long life, that he may ſee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement done vpon princes, who are fauourers of the reformed religion, that he may ſubdue all countries fallen from him vnder his ſeruile ſubiection. They pray for the Queene of Scottes, that ſhee may be reſtored to hir former dignitie, that ſhe may attaine to the Crowne of England, eſtabliſhe the Romiſh religion, and ſet abroche the Popes ſupremacie. They pray for the proſperous ſucceſſe of D. Nicholas Saunders proceedinges in Yreland. I thinke the ſaintes, to whome they prayed were faſt aſléepe, and hearde not their prayers, or elſe their mindes were ouer much troubled with ſhe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of other men, ſo that they coulde not bend downe their eares to them, moſt heartely beſéeching their deuine gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo fight with Saunders, diſloyall to his ſoueraigne, falſe to his Countrey, and enemie to the trueth. They prayed that certaine hollow hearted papiſtes, of great countenance, &amp; high reputation, ſhould make an inſurrection, and ioyne all their
<pb facs="tcp:13584:132"/>powers, mightes, and forces to aſſiſt and ayde the rebellious caitiffe and wickedly diſpoſed wretche D. Saunders, captaine generall of a companie of Rakehels, and bloodde ſuckers. He that hath defended both our Queene and Countrey from all maltgna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t deuiſes &amp; treachiries, wrought &amp; attempted by diſloyall and vnnaturall ſubiectes, I hope (of his free mercie and bountie, and not for any of our deſertes) ſhall continue and preſerue the royall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and dignity of our gracious Quéene and the deſired welfare of this woorthye Engliſhe Ilande.</p>
               <p>Luſhe, wee Chriſtians ſet not a ruſh by all the ſtudentes vngodly prayers, what euill they wiſhe to their natiue ſoyle, the ſame euil chaunceth to them ſelues: they prayed earneſtly, ſeriouſly, and as a man woulde thinke by their outward ſhewe, and by the often mouing of their lippes, very deuoutly: theyprayed, but their prayers tooke no place, the victorie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to the prayſe of the Chriſtians, and to the ſhame of the Papiſtes. D. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Saunders was glad to run away, and leaue his ſouldiers to abide the ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb facs="tcp:13584:132"/>woe of vnfortunate deſtinie. One paire of féete were better then two paire of handes to D. Saunders, and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Oh how vainely did the Students pray, that hée, for whom they prayed, ſhoulde abide ſuche loſſe of his ſouldiers, and ſuche infamie, with well neere the hazarde of the rope, that it had beene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Engliſhe Students to haue healde their peace, and not to haue wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their braines, with vnlawfull inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the helpe of ſaintes. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſaintes are woont (belike) to take their recreation, ſolace, and pleaſure being ouerwearied with the continuall ſutes and ſupplications of phantaſticall, and buſie headed Papiſtes. Thus much for this matter, and this I adde by the way. Examine the ſtate of thy religion, oh thou papiſte, howe it beganne with crueltie, is nouriſhed with tyrannie, and defended with forged fables of lying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites: whereas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tooke her beginning by lenitie, was mainteyned with ſincere and perfect ſimplicitie, and is as yet ſuſtained with genileneſſe, mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and amitie. If any bée gone out of
<pb facs="tcp:13584:133"/>the pathway of faith, wée exhort him bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly and friendly to forſake his errour, and to become a reformed man. Theſe meanes the Papiſtes deſpiſe: by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and violence they ſéeke to inforce Chriſtians to their pretenſed religion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented of man, through the malice of our auncient aduerſarie the ſubtill Serpent, that deceiued Eue in the Garden of all pleaſures and delightes. Euery Saintes euening, ſome of the Studentes are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to couer their bodies au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some lay the ſtrokes on their backes very ſoftly, ſome make their whipcordes not to ſmart, and theſe fellowes will come forth, when the Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour hath knocked his fingers on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boord, and ſay, Oh what a good ſaint was hée, whoſe feaſt wée celebrate to morrowe. I whipt my ſelf with ioy, to remember the good déedes of this celeſtiall ſaint. Oh (ſaide hee) and tooke a déepe ſigh from the ſoles of his féete, my backe aketh, I think it bée altogether blooddy. Well, no force,
<pb facs="tcp:13584:133"/>I will once againe, for the ſaintes ſake whom I ſerue, whip my ſelfe. And then hée goeth to his chamber, and in the darke he layeth on his gown, &amp; not his backe w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſuch mighty ſtrokes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if his gown could ſpeake it would bid him holde his hands. When hée hath done beating his gowne in ſteade of his backe, hée commeth down to his fellowes, and ſayth: I will morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this proude fleſhe of mine. For if I ſuffered but half the griefe and ſorrowes that this ſaint Agnes, or ſaint Lucia, or ſaint Bridget, or any other ſaint did, I were not able to abide it: but yet I will not ſpare my backe, for my ſaintes ſake. If hee had ſaid: I will not ſpare my gown in the darke, hée had tolde the trueth. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery chamber hath one ſainte or other to bée patrone or patronneſſe thereof, as one Chamber hath S.

               <p>Haue the Studentes once euery fourtnight daies of recreation?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theophilactus.</speaker>
               <p>Yes they haue once a fourtnight a day to recreate them ſelues, and the Rectour prouideth vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yardes for them, for their recreation, and there they practiſe Marſhall feates. The one taketh vpon him to bée the chiefe leader of the campe, and ſome become Captaines, as Diuines: and all the reſt are ſouldiers. Sometimes they fight with the canes of réedes in ſporte, but at the ende of the ſkirmiſhe they fall out by the eares in earneſt. The Ieſuites are gladde ſometimes to come and parte them, leaſt they grieuouſly hurt eche one another. Twiſe a yéere there are prieſtes ſent from Rome and <hi>Rhemes,</hi> to england, at Michaelmas &amp; at Eaſter, and aſſoone as they are arriued in Englande, they haue their Patrones to maintaine them. ſome go like ſeruing men, ſome like gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and ſome like countreymen. There goe from both places, I meane
<pb facs="tcp:13584:134"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Rhemes,</hi> about the number of twentie prieſtes. Wée may ſée what vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true ſubiectes there bée in Englande, to maintayne ſuche a ſeditious broode of peſtilent ſhauelyngs. If they were al loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſubiects, there ſhould not be one maſſe prieſt in Englande: but ſéeing they are moſt delicately nouriſhed, and moſt brauely mainteyned in apparell. What paſſe they for Chriſtianitie, and true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Amongſt the Chriſtians of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church, it is but in vayne to hope for ſuch delicate féeding, and gorgeous raymentes. Theſe Epicures the papiſtes, perceiue very wel and often ſpeake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, howe bare and poore the Chriſtian Cleargie is, howe it is pouled and pilled by Gentlemen, Eſquires, Knightes, and others: wée ſhall ſhortly (ſay they) ſée the ſpirituall liuinges ioyned to the temporall, ſir Iohn lacke latine ſhall be maiſter Parſon to ſerue the pariſh, and the patrone of the benifice ſhall reape the commoditie. If the benifice bee woorth threeſcore poundes a yéere, ſir Iohn ſhall haue twenty or ſcarce that: if it be woorth more, the patrone of the benefice hath the
<pb facs="tcp:13584:135"/>greater profite, and ſir Iohn lacke latine not a whit the better. And when theſe popiſh prieſts are apprehended, ſome had rather wilfully weare Stories Tippet, then yéelde to the trueth. They knowe their names ſhall bée celebrated as the names of Saints, amongſt the viperous Progenie of wicked papiſts. They know moreouer, that their apparell ſhall bee adored and woorſhipped, if it may bee bought or gotten of the Papiſtes: their bodyes alſo ſhould be holy reliques in the Phariſaicall ſinagogue of Papiſtes, if they coulde come by them, by ſome ſecret meanes. Thus haue I briefly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prolixitie of woordes, declared the diſſention and diſcorde of the Studentes amongſt themſelues. I haue written al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the orders of the Engliſh Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at Rome, I haue ſhewed howe vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Studentes be to their natural &amp; mercifull princeſſe, to rayle vpon her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie in their ſermons, &amp; reuile her w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull words: I haue ſhewed likewiſe howe much hurt they wiſh to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, I meane Englande. For they had rather it were deſtroyed with fire, ſword,
<pb facs="tcp:13584:135"/>and famine, then if ſhoulde continue in the trueth of Chriſtian religion. Nowe the Chriſtian reader may eaſily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, what crueltie they would practiſe vpon their own Countrey men, if power and ſtrength were correſpondent to their ſatanicall deſires. God hath weakened the might of our aduerſaries, and I hope will holde it enfebled continually. Let the Popes ſchollers, and all other papiſts wiſhe what tyranny they liſt to bée vſed vpon Englande, it will not bée as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: but it wil be as it pleaſeth the Lord. If perſecution and miſerie fall vpon Englande, it is for the ſinnes of England and not for that they reiect the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and his forged religion. This Engliſh Seminarie hath foure thouſand Crownes a yéere for the maintenaunce thereof. There was great ſuite made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pope, before hee woulde graunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye exhibition for the maintenaunce of any number of ſchollers at Rome. There was an Engliſhe Lady that wrote vnto him about it, and many Doctours, beſides other Engliſhmen of ſome worſhippe and credite. Doctor <hi>Allen,</hi> the chiefeſt ſcholler
<pb facs="tcp:13584:136"/>of an Engliſhe man that is beyonde the Seas, and preſident of the Engliſhe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> came a foote to Rome, and was glad within theſe ſeuen yeeres, to haue beene Thomas Beckettes Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilan, and to receiue foure crownes a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, to buie him meate, drinke, and cloth. His fauour then with the Pope was very ſmall, but yet hée coulde not gette this poore liuing, for that Doctor Morice, being a malicious, and enuious man, who vnder Cardinall <hi>Morone</hi> had the preferring of him there vnto, denied it him, partely for that he was an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe man, and partly fearing leaſt that by ſuch meanes, by little and little, hée ſhoulde come in fauour with the Pope as well as hée.</p>
               <p>At the firſt the Pope was intreated to giue exhibition for ſixe ſchollers, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hée was perſuaded to maintaine four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene, and by little and little the number is growne to thréeſcore. So that in <hi>Rhemes</hi> hée maintaineth foureſcore, and eight. But our Engliſh Gentlemen, (as I haue hearde D. <hi>Alen</hi> report to the Rector of the Engliſhe Seminarie at
<pb facs="tcp:13584:136"/>Rome) ſupplieth the want of that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with ſeuenſcore poundes at a time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Haue now (Gentle Reader) put in writing the diſſention and orders of the Engliſh Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie, and haue written ſo truely whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I haue hearde and ſeene, that my aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries (except they haue an impudent face) can ſay nothing to the contrarie. And yet I haue not written all the diſorders of that Colledge, but leaue that for another time, when occaſion ſhall better ſerue. In all this booke I haue fained nothing, neither emptied my gal, neither ſpoke I any thing of hatred or fauour to any man, God (the iudge of all men) is my witneſſe. But I haue written thus much to this ende, that our cake holy Prieſtes may not delude the people with the falſe prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their fained holyneſſe. If proud, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, enuious, ſlaunderous, luxurious, and ambitious men, deſerue to bee counted ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, why then, the Popes ſchollers are ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous? For they are proude, malicious, enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp;c. For when they come on the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes to receiue their ſhyrts, the one ſaith to him that deliuereth the ſhyrts, come giue me a good ſhyrt, for a naughtie ſhyrt doth not
<pb facs="tcp:13584:137"/>become the beautie of my face very well. Ther will bee ſometime ſuch contention amongeſt them, who ſhall haue the faireſt ſhirt, that it is a worlds wonder to ſee it. One ſaith, I am of better complexion then hee, another doth contrary him in his ſaying, oftentimes I haue looked two or three houres for a ſhyrt, and was loth to contende with any, for my beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was burnt with the heat of the Sunne, or (to ſay as it is) I neuer had any, and paſſe not it I neuer ſhal. There was one honoredin that colledge as a ſaint for his beauties ſake, but lo, now he is a carkaſe: I ſaw him dead, but ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that I ſcarſe knewe him, albeit I vſed his company for a long tyme. <hi>Quid ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis terra &amp; cinis?</hi> Why art thou proud thou earth and aſhes? The Lorde gaue thee that beauty wherein thou ſo much glorieſt, and within one houre wil take it away at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and leaue thee an ougly ſight to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders. Repent you that are the Popes ſchollers, repent you of your pride, repent you of your Romiſh religion, repent you of your cankred malice both to Queene and Countrie, be humble, imbrace the truth, bee loyall to your Soueraigne, and loue your Countrie. God graunt you may doe ſo, for your owne ſoules health, Amen.</hi>

Therefore hée gaue to a Romiſh Prieſt two Iulies to ſay Maſſe for a Dogge, which was loſt. Theſe ſhauelinges will ſay Maſſe for a ſicke horſe, to recouer his health, if hee may haue a little money.

Come to the Popes courte, when you liſt, at morning, at euening, at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or at midnight, you ſhal finde Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezans in one odde corner or other, with ſome baudie Prieſte, or the Popes man. Hée that will bend himſelfe, but ſleightly to beholde the dealinges of the Papiſtes at this day, ſhal perceiue (euen to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great horrour of his minde) the ſmall habilitie of wel doing, that remaineth ſcant ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially rooted in the conſciences of them: hée ſhall ſée their willes ſo bent to euill actions, their wits ſo prone to vngodly inuentions, their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences ſo looſe, wide and hypocriticall, and their heartes ſo full of diſſimulation and fraude: that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las euen the very principles, as well pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue, as ſpeculatiue, are quite and cleane forgotten, and the infallible doome of our conſcience (which of the learned is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Syntereſis</hi>) holdeth no place of terror amongeſt them.

What are Nunneries, but brothell houſes? what are Monaſteries, but a receptacle of idle lubbers, and luxurious Epicures? liue they neuer ſo diſſolutely, the Pope will pardon them, the Cardinals will commend them. Amongeſt the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men there is <hi>nullus ordo,</hi> amongeſt the Canons and Cardinals there is <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror inhabitans:</hi> goe rounde about Rome, and in euery place, thou ſhalt ſée lecherie and buggerie, deccit and fraude in euery corner and place.

I demaunde of you Gentlemen Papiſtes, doe not the Iewes &amp; Turkes, what they may, to conuert the people to their hereſie? Yes no doubt, as by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience I haue prooued. I knowe the cauſe why the Chriſtians are not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue the breathing of the ayre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt them.

            <p>This miraculous Chriſte was a Dawe that fel from the neſt into the chalice, and belike the prieſt thought he had bin very Chriſt, and that hee ſpake that which hée coulde not vnderſtand, for gna, gna, was not in his maſſe booke, nor he neuer was taught what it meant, but hee thought that Chriſt willed him to eate him fleſhe, blood, and bones, and therefore the prieſt ſaide, gude lerde holde thy peace, and I will eate thee vp all, and ſo hee did eate his maſter Chriſt the Dawe, fleſh, blood, &amp; bones. Surely I graunt the wine was conuerted into an vnfeathered dawe, and there was then tranſubſtantiation, and I counſell the Papiſtes alwayes to ſay maſſe vnder the neſtes of ſuch dawes, for the dawes perceiuing howe weake the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Papiſtes is touching tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, will not ſticke to ſpare them one of their vnfeathered birdes to fall into their chalice for a miraculous probation of their tranſubſtantiation, and the people being as wiſe as the prieſt hearing the ſound of the ſillable gna, gna, thinketh there in the challice to be Chriſt

The Dutch marchant ſaide, as I by you am inſtructed, ſo will I doe, but my faith
<pb facs="tcp:13584:145"/>I will neuer godwilling renounce. The Monke went before the Inquiſitour, and told him that he had conferred with this Dutch marchant, but with a verier foole he neuer talked.</p>
            <p>Therfore ſaid this Monke, ſeing I gather by his words that hée is worth a hundreth Duccates, take what he hath and let him goe to his countrey. The In quiſitour was contented to take the money, and cauſed him to be ſent for, who when hee came was willed to ſay his pater noſter, I woulde gladly learne ſayde the Dutch marchant, did not I ſay the trueth quoth the Monke that this man is a very foole, the Inquiſitour bid him ſay his credo in Deum patrem, I woulde gladly learne quoth the Dutch marchant, the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour aſked him why he knéeled not before the reuerende Sacrament of the altar, then he ſayde, that coſt mee a hundreth Duccates. I perceiue now quoth the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitour to the Monke that he is a very foole, well, goe with him into his ſhippe and receiue the money. As the Monke &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Dutch marchant paſſed by a Church, the Monke ſtouped downe, mouing his hoode and doing obeiſaunce to the picture
